- So the first thing i'd like to say is that it's ridiculously exciting to be here.
- This is quite the amazing place and i've been preparing to talk to you for a long time, so i'm really looking forward to it.
- You said something that caught me right away when we were discussing various issues.
- Just before we started, you said you were up till 4:00 in the morning to start up training in 19 days, which is the fastest that anyone has ever gotten a super computer.
- Tell me what you think about this.
- Also, there's a golden thread of conversation that constitutes the basis for humanity's education, let's say that's run across centuries and, in principle, those with that concentrates on ideas that have been winnowed, probably through a quasi evolutionary process across large spans of time, to get documents out of that, like the well, like the king james bible, for example, and there's zeroing in on core conceptual structures that we don't even necessarily explicitly understand.
- It seems to me that when we take young people and we give them a genuine humanity's education, we saw the alignment problem for them now.
- So the question is not transmitted.
- So this next to something that's very essential, which is: well, what's the difference?
- That say, or is there a difference between the western canon, let's say in the latest woke nonsense.
- Now, i've used draw a lot and it's not as well as chat, gpt, but it's still woke like it's still deviation.
- So so how are you?
- Can you address that?
- By it's just a language model at the moment.
- Let's say if it also understood images, if it was supposed to behavior.
- Ok, google, i've been wondering.
- I know tesla's a car company, but when i look at work, well, maybe more like those are cars, those are autonomous robots, robots, robots.
- So what advantage do you have, given that you have all this real world out of that you've gathered from your automobile?
- So we really need, we have a lot of catching up to do to companies that have been around for 5:10. from getting hardware installation to it, beginning training was only 19 days and that's the fastest by far that anyone's been able to do that.
- So we're moving quickly but we still catching up.
- And so if you use up to gemini clothes, how do you feel that fast?
- How do you feel the rock performance in relationship to now?
- Well, so the garage version, the foundation model of of rock, is still an order of magnitude weaker than chesapeake.
- So it's quite well, given that order of magnitude of difference to actually finished training with roughly probably finish training in about 3 or 4 months, and then there'll be some fine-tuning and bug fixing- what not?
- And we're hoping to release rock 3 by december and it's got three- should be the most powerful ai in the world.
- At that point- i have worked with lots of undergraduates and graduates with chachi pt is, if you can corner it into behaving properly, that you kind of have something approximating a team of, i would say, masters degree level intelligence and something like that.
- What are you envisioned for this new?
- Well, let's say, the new york three.
- And then you talked about delving deeper into this structure of the universe, and you are a remarkably forward-looking person.
- So what do you?
- What the hell do you think you're building with these systems?
- Like what is this?
- What i think amityville is digital, digital superintelligence, so, and intelligence thus far smarter than any, any human, and then, ultimately, an intelligence that is far smarter than all humans combined.
- No one can say like, is this a wise thing to do?
- Isn't this, isn't it?
- Well, unfortunately, we have a choice of being a spectator or a participant.
- But that's life period.
- Why do you?
- Why, okay, so why do you trust yourself on that front?
- Just out of me.
- That's an important question about myself, or directions to the others, are going, i think, trained to be politically correct and the work my virus is woven in throughout them.
- I'm sure you've seen that.
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.
- You know, my students used to ask me when i, cuz i've been teaching what i've been teaching for about 40 years, and one of the questions they used to ask me is how i knew that what i was teaching wasn't just another ideology, right, cuz the postmodern take is: well, all it is is a plethora of power games, and so there's no rain quartering approaches to the truth in terms of their ethical suitability.
- But that's not the game that you're playing right now.
- I think you can look at like: likely enhance or decrease enlightenment?
- Will any given belief system improve our understanding of the universe?
- Will we learn more things?
- Will we achieve a deeper understanding of physics, and so that's grounded, at least in part, in a scientific framework.
- From the sounds of it, i mean, i think there are facts about the world.
- There are things that are extremely- is about 99.99% to be true.
- You can run experiments: 1% volume, probability of being true or untrue, or probability of being relevant to an argument or not relevant to not going to be just talking about the basics of of coaches here.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, so let me.
- Let me put it on that too.
- So one of the things that really struck me about your public pronouncements in recent years was your insistence that we're in a natal crisis and that that's actually a problem, because it's actually true.
- Well, it depends whether you think that the planet would be better off if it was the population.
- So what?
- Ok, google 1880 was trying to get my finger on that.
- There was a recent research article published on this too, and he needed lists- are much more likely to show dark, red traits: machiavellian, psychopathic, narcissistic and sadistic, because those first three weren't enough right.
- And so those things are tightly aligned, especially the best predictor with psychopathy for being an antinatalist.
- Sure, alright, alright, well, in the past are very, very, very, very, very self-centered, right, it's like overgrown two year olds, overgrown aggressive 2 year old.
- So that's not good.
- How did you start to understand that the one of the fundamental ethical problems is different than the scientific problem?
- One of the fundamental ethical problems that's playing the west is this catastrophically low birth rate of 20 + 0.34, extrapolating any demographic of.
- But if you, if i was preface by saying if these trends continue, most countries will will dwindle into insignificance, they might completely die out.
- So i'm thinking about that in relationship to sacred images of masculinity in the west is chris fiction, but a man isn't a woman.
- The sacred image of a woman is a woman and an infant, right?
- So chris images, the feminine is conceptualized as the combination of female and infant- than the culture has lost its attachment to the traditional sacred images and is probably on its way out.
- Yeah, i think there is an argumentative and in a way it's an attempt to solve the alignment problem.
- Okay, so there's a unity of moral purpose, that that is conceptualized in the traditional what should be put in the highest place?
- So it's god in in the final analysis.
- Its ineffable, but it is a fundamental uni, unification, monotheism, okay.
- Now here is a hypothesis.
- When that collapses, two things arise to replace it.
- Okay, one is this driving for power, and the other is the untrammeled- what would you call it?
- The untrammeled dominion of hedonism, and especially on the sexual gratification side.
- So it's like if there's no ultimate unity that's future and community-oriented, that's predicated on sacrifice, you get a dissolution immediately into the next two contenders for domination, and one is: it's about me, buddy, and get the hell out of the way.
- And aligned with that is: not only is it about me, it's about me what would you say something to my most?
- Because why would i want power except to do exactly what the hell i want whenever i want to?
- And so part of the problem with the idea of people like talking so dawkins, long, yeah, yeah.
- And then you also did publicly proclaim it at a time when the insistence, the moral insistence, was all on the side of you know jane goodall's pronouncements that if we don't reduce the population of the planet dramatically, that the nature, goddess, is going to be upset, which is also a very, very old idea, not a very good one.
- So so i'm very curious about your intuition there, like that's a long time ago.
- And so how did you caught on to the fact that that antagonistic attitude towards birth that's embedded in our culture now with something that should be called out and that was pathological?
- Well, i mean, i should go back to what is the foundation of, because you know to explain my actions.
- So they, when i was- i don't know- about 11 or 12 years old, i had someone of an existential crisis, because it just doesn't seem to be any meaning in the world, like i said, no meaning to life.
- And so i actually read all the religious texts and obviously going to understand these things well enough to have an existential crisis, comes up with other value of everyone who's made in the image of god.
- It's something like that.
- But the third thing is, once you do those two things, you can concentrate on the moment.
- See, you're not seems to be even technically, you can think about this- neuropsychological.
- So, if you're looking for meaning, meaning is a form of incentive reward, and incentive reward is stupid, mediated, and incentive reward occurs in relationship to advancement towards a goal, which is a form of entropy minimization, as it turns out, of something: alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
- Well, negative emotions signifies the emergence of entropy.
- Positive emotion on the dopamine signals, it's reduction.
- But there's something that's more complex there, because the higher the goal that you're trying to attain, intrinsic value each step towards it comprises, and that's neuropsychological accurate, and so part of the wisdom of the sermon on the mount is that, if you pause it, the highest imaginable goal than any step towards it is the captures.
- Your attention is also deeply meaningful, and so that's an answer to what the meaning is of process, rather than say something like 42, and you said- it seems to me that you were intimidating- that your discovery through adams- that the question was the thing- was to the resolution of your existential crisis.
- Okay, so that's part of the reason that you're motivated to say building to understand what i was about.
- Okay, well, i'm just going to accept that we are ignorant of a great many things and we should be less ignorant and anything we can do that will improve our understanding of the universe and make us less ignorant and have a deeper understanding of the universe and even more questions to answer, to ask about the answer that is universe, which is, i think, adams central point is good and so that was good and so like.
- Is this a religion?
- I don't know, maybe it is, but i think it's a good one period.
- The ancient god of the mesopotamians- his name- was the best defense attorney.
- He was literally play the mesopotamians.
- He was the agent that revitalized the tyrannical state and overcame evil, and also the force that dispensed with chaos and built something magnificent and cosmic out of it.
- Right?
- So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They asked him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been a good attendance and speaking properly in the previous message.
- If you don't use that vision, if each citizen doesn't use that vision, it's replaced by the totalitarian, all-seeing eye, right, right, so that's a hell of a thing to know.
- Okay, so that, okay, so that's cool.
- So i wonder, i see, i see, cuz i wondered what motivated you, cuz you pushing so many directions simultaneously, you have to be really highly motivated to do that.
- And so you figured out that the question, in a sense, was the answer.
- The question and a better understanding of the universe is something that we can continue to do as a civilization for a very long time, yeah, yeah, like forever.
- So that's okay.
- On things that improve our understanding of the universe at a base level, well, this is why i actually think we want to population increase, because population increase means that there are more people, that we've expanded the scale, yeah, we've expanded the scale of consciousness, of consciousness, so that there's something of marks.
- And he went and looked at mark's poetry and drama that he wrote before he wrote the communist manifesto and he found out something very interesting.
- He found out that marks.
- His favorite quote from bertha was a statement by mephistopheles.
- It's a very specific statement and it's a very motivation.
- So lucifer's motivation is predicated on this argument.
- Said, consciousness is nothing but consciousness of pain and misery.
- Life is short and brutal and pointless.
- Therefore, it would be better if consciousness itself was eradicated.
- Understand that life without social order would degenerated into that.
- But the memphis, tennessee, it is the very definition of crazy right now, the definition of the adversarial spirit.
- Now, let's say, is that that's wrong in the consciousness should be so.
- Then we say so why should consciousness be expanded if it's nothing but consciousness of suffering?
- And your answer: lots of people suffer like slots, an existential crisis.
- So it's, it's, it's, it's not.
- It's an obviously false statement that life is really so one of the things i've tried to do is to understand.
- So like there are a limited number of things that are.
- But i was very close with with larry page is one of my best friends and in fact i'd stay at his house because i've spent half the week in the bay area running tesla, in half in la running spacex and and for the longest time i never even had a house in the area.
- I would just stay at friends.
- Friends places that spare room.
- I stay there if they didn't have to sleep on the couch and- and i find actually i didn't have a house for more than a decade- road to catch up with friends and, and so i would have these conversations with our page long into the night about increasingly concerned that he was not sufficiently concerned about ai safety.
- And i want point, he did call me a species.
- Yes, you are one, yes, yes, i guess, correctly labeled like the other people and everyone will just be robots, yeah, and for a while, the price of our intrinsic limitations, and that is a difficult, bitter, let's say, pill to swallow.
- But i also think so.
- I thought recently: you know, how do you know that something's real?
- Say: death makes things real, death makes things real.
- And so if you, if you eradicate death, it seems to me that in some fundamental level, you also eradicate reality itself.
- So i don't know, because i think you really could evolve human evolution.
- It's better for organisms to have a finite life and death.
- Death brings renewal, essentially.
- And i think we do need to be cautious about trying to solve longevity in a love forever type sense, because i think our, our society, our culture would ossify and the people in power would always remain in power.
- You know, if you had said, 10,000 year span of consciousness with no sleep.
- I don't know what the hell you'd be if that was who you were, but you would be human.
- And then we also don't understand that.
- See, part of the problem, i think, with the perspective that the technology to human existence is that there's a reductionism there.
- That's something.
- It's something like there's no difference between us and the gist of our linguistic network, something like that, like whatever we are is conscious of a lot deeper than the patterns of what make up our cortical existence.
- Consciousness is way deeper than cortical existence and maybe i do think you have to sort of this question of where, where does consciousness arise?
- Traditional christian, but it drives many more cells, eventually reaching to.
- An adult human has 30 to 40 trillion cells.
- So where, where, where, where does is it?
- Where is consciousness right?
- Does it grow slowly?
- Is there a step change?
- And you know i tend to generally believed in physics and you seem to have done pretty well and everything else is a recommendation.
- So if you, if you have beliefs that are incompatible with a rocket, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right now is a host judge, that's definitely, definitely.
- Do you think he's llms like?
- Do you think that any of the machinery that you've interacted with is showing anything, signs of anything that might be equated to consciousness?
- Mineola limbs are remarkable, right in.
- They certainly pass the turing test as far as i'm concerned: period tokens, and those tokens are more than one letter, and so it actually really it's.
- It's my office.
- With respect to single letters.
- Go to resolution problem.
- Yeah, yeah, you can get around with this with like weird tricks, like if you have to write a computer program to count the number of letters, in a word, it can create that computer program, run it and then and then get the number of letters correct.
- Right now is nothing conscious potentially, and i think you want to, just when you're trying to understand something, consider the various possible answers, and i think that there's a probability associated with each one of these answers.
- Now, if physics is correct, universe started off with and that that coalesced into stars, that exploded when a car, less than stars, you had the formation of heavier elements, and and then those dogs have scattered and then reformed and made new stars and so eventually got elements that are higher in the periodic table besides the ones.
- Yeah, so this is, this is what physics consciousness?
- Well, yeah, so the point is that the universe, and give it enough time, you have more, your complex heavy elements and will complex molecules, and and then, 13.8 billion years later, at least on this planet, we have what we call consciousness, in the form you know.
- But that means consciousness had to arise from hydrogen.
- I've seen your comments to the same sort of thing that my friend jonathan has been trying to elucidate: structure of possibility.
- He associates with the concept of heaven, like there's an implicit structure of possibility that material forms are trying to flush out.
- The possibility of consciousness is inherent in the hydrogen atoms.
- Right, obviously, because representations, you have three fundamental elements.
- You have something like order which you can think about, is society, but it's, it's the, it's the, a prairie, axiomatic interpretive structure.
- You have that.
- Then you have chaotic potential.
- That's the tofu that exists at the beginning of time, and so the way god is represented in the story of genesis is that.
- So god is the a priori interpretive process that gives rise to order as a consequence of manipulating potential, and the intermediary factor is the word.
- That's the christian conception, and the word is something like the sacrificial gesture that's that's necessary for learning to take place.
- So you can imagine this when you learn something.
- It's not only that you add to a storehouse that you have, it's that something that you already know has to undergo a death and a transformational.
- Most real learning is painful.
- You think about it.
- More chaos is associated with.
- That can be exciting, but it can also be destabilizing- not existential crisis- that you have had great potential.
- It was without its pain right.
- So if you imagine the axiom hierarchy go, the more chaos is released when that actually was challenged, you get a negative national response to that with his anxiety and threat, because god only knows what happens when all hell breaks loose.
- But there's a positive aspect too.
- That's why it's a dragon and a treasure always in the hero mythology.
- It's because when all hell breaks loose, there's a man's opportunity and so- and that's part of the meaning now i think you capitalize on that treasure, let's say on the treasure portion of that chaos, by assuming something like your own ignorance, by allowing your initial preconceptions to die and by tracking the trail of deep and insistent questioning.
- So now you, your questioning, took the place.
- If i got it right, you basically took the scientific fact.
- Is that right?
- Because i'm trying to send a truth, the truth of the universe, and physics is essentially study of the truth of the universe, at least those things that are predictable.
- Existential crisis, which happened about the same time years did i started.
- I didn't study science precisely, i wasn't as interested in the transformations of the material world, so i'm probably more people-oriented than thing oriented temperamentally.
- So i started study evil.
- That was my delving into the depths, because i wanted to crack that.
- I want to understand, if not so much because i became consistent with that very quickly.
- But what exactly that had to do with me?
- Cuz when i was reading history tomorrow, i try to understand the rise and fall of civilizations.
- And what do you think makes them fall?
- Or one of the things is a decreasing birth rate, which seems to be a natural consequence of prosperity.
- As far as i know, that is experience, population of the emergence, something like a, a nonstick egocentrism.
- Well, examples of civilizations prosperous: there is generally a trend towards hedonism.
- Well, you can get away with it if you're worth it, because the consequences of exactly precisely so you know if you're, if you're a civilization who was in the varieties of religious experience, and that really had an effect on me, because i think that you need something akin to an existential threat in order to set you straight, i think there's some truth about you know.
- It's like, if it's a, if it's a spoiled child, that were everything he or she wants and you have sort of a veruca.
- Salt is a civilization, i think it's the right way to think about it developmentally, a neuropsychology, because maturation itself consists of two processes.
- Let's say i am, the more i'm bringing other people into the purview of my vision, so i extend myself across other people, be my family first, but then brought the community more broadly.
- The better you aren't that, the more people you can play a game with at the same time.
- But you also do the same thing with the future, and that's actually, as far as i can tell, what the cortex is, for.
- It's to move you away from primordial hedonistic motivation to this morning inclusive sense of future and community right, and that's higher order self, and so the default would be immaturity, and wealth can obviously facilitate that, and maybe it's partly because, okay, so you're a very wealthy man, you can give your children anything they ever ask for: fights, and a father who is a difficult creature to continue, and are you grateful for it or are you unhappy about it?
- I guess you never know the things that really made you who you are today.
- So, at the end of the day, am i on netflix for my life?
- I am.
- I'm leaving the rough details of your childhood- a lot of physical nations and a lot of- i don't know exactly what i mean.
- I was almost beaten to death within an inch of my life at one point location.
- About that, cuz that's a pathway that people take.
- I think that people do take the path of vengeance and justify it by recourse to the reality of their own suffering.
- So the story of joke.
- One of the things i concluded from the story of joke, because it's a precursor to the- the first decision is that, no matter how terrible things become for him, he will not lose faith in himself.
- And the second is: no matter what horrors are visited on him by satan himself, he will not lose faith in the- what would you say?
- In the spirit that gave rise to the cosmic order, right, no matter what?
- Well, so you know why i'm not a particularly religious person.
- The teachings of jesus are good and why is, and that there's tremendous wisdom.
- And turn the other cheek, and for a while- that's really a week.
- Yeah, i think you should turn the others with them, but they need to stop stop playing.
- You know, make peace.
- Christianity proclamation or admission that if you compare different societies and their axiomatic suppositions, he would prefer the ones predicated on christianity assumptions, and i do think those are good ones.
- Okay, so, okay, so.
- So that's why i asked you the question about why you would consider yourself not a religious person, because it seems to me that the essence of it isn't, it isn't the statement that you abide by a particular protestant creed, let's say.
- It seems to be much more akin to the notion that you believe that this set of axiomatic positions is, like the name society, the greatest happiness for humanity.
- So the first thing i'd like to say is that it's ridiculously exciting to be here.
- This is quite the amazing place and i've been preparing to talk to you for a long time, so i'm really looking forward to it.
- You said something that caught me right away when we were discussing various issues.
- Just before we started, you said you were up till 4:00 in the morning to start up training in 19 days, which is the fastest that anyone has ever gotten a super computer.
- Tell me what you think about this.
- Also, there's a golden thread of conversation that constitutes the basis for humanity's education, let's say that's run across centuries and, in principle, those with.
- That concentrates on ideas that have been winnowed, probably through a quasi evolutionary process across large spans of time, to get documents out of that, like the well, like the king james bible, for example, and there's zeroing in on core conceptual structures that we don't even necessarily explicitly understand.
- It seems to me that when we take young people and we give them a genuine humanity's education, we saw the alignment problem for them now, so the question is not transmitted.
- So this next to something that's very essential, which is: well, what's the difference?
- That say, or is there a difference between the western canon, let's say, in the latest woke nonsense.
- Now, i've used draw a lot and it's not as well as chat, gpt, but it's still woke like, it's still deviation.
- So so how are you?
- Can you address that?
- By it's just a language model at the moment, let's say, if it also understood images, if it was supposed to behavior, ok, google, i've been wondering.
- I know tesla's a car company, but when i look at work, well, maybe more like those are cars, those are autonomous robots, robots, robots.
- So what advantage do you have, given that you have all this real world out of that you've gathered from your automobile.
- So we really need.
- We have a lot of catching up to do to companies that have been around for 5:10 from getting hardware installation to it.
- Beginning training was only 19 days and that's the fastest by far that anyone's been able to do that.
- So we're moving quickly but we still catching up.
- And so if you use up to gemini clothes, how do you feel that fast?
- How do you feel the rock performance in relationship to now?
- Well, so the garage version, the foundation model of of rock, is still an order of magnitude weaker than chesapeake.
- So it's quite well, given that order of magnitude of difference, to actually finished training with roughly probably finish training in about 3 or 4 months, and then there'll be some fine-tuning and bug fixing, what not?
- And we're hoping to release rock 3 by december and it's got three should be the most powerful ai in the world.
- At that point i have worked with lots of undergraduates and graduates with chachi pt is, if you can corner it into behaving properly, that you kind of have something approximating a team of, i would say, masters degree level intelligence and something like that.
- What are you envisioned for this new?
- Well, let's say the new york three, and then you talked about delving deeper into this structure of the universe, and you are a remarkably forward-looking person.
- So what do you?
- What the hell do you think you're building with these systems like?
- What is this?

- Well, unfortunately, we have a choice of being a spectator or a participant.
- But that's life period.
- Why do you?
- Why?
- Okay, so why do you trust yourself on that front?
- Just out of me, that's an important question about myself, or directions to the others are going, i think, trained to be politically correct and the work- my virus is woven in throughout them.
- I'm sure you've seen that.
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.

- From the sounds of it, i mean.
- I think there are facts about the world.
- There are things that are extremely is about 99.99% to be true.
- You can run experiments: 1% volume, probability of being true or untrue, or probability of being relevant to an argument or not relevant to not.
- Going to be just talking about the basics of of coaches here, yeah, yeah, okay, so let me, let me put it on that too.
- So one of the things that really struck me about your public pronouncements in recent years was your insistence that we're in a natal crisis and that that's actually a problem, because it's actually true.

- Its ineffable, but it is a fundamental uni, unification, monotheism.
- Okay.
- Now here is a hypothesis.
- When that collapses, two things arise to replace it.
- Okay, one is this driving for power, and the other is the untrammeled- what would you call it?
- The untrammeled dominion of hedonism, and especially on the sexual gratification side.
- So it's like, if there's no ultimate unity that's future and community-oriented, that's predicated on sacrifice, you get a dissolution immediately into the next two contenders for domination.
- And one is: it's about me, buddy, and get the hell out of the way.
- And aligned with that is: not only is it about me, it's about me what would you say something to my most?
- Because why would i want power except to do exactly what the hell i want whenever i want to.
- And so part of the problem with the idea of people like talking, so dawkins, long, yeah, yeah.
- And then you also did publicly proclaim it at a time when the insistence, the moral insistence, was all on the side of you know, jane goodall's pronouncements that if we don't reduce the population of the planet dramatically, that the nature, goddess, is going to be upset, which is also a very, very old idea, not a very good one.
- So so i'm very curious about your intuition there, like that's a long time ago.
- And so how did you caught on to the fact that that antagonistic attitude towards birth that's embedded in our culture now with something that should be called out and that was pathological?
- Well, i mean, i should go back to what is the foundation of because you know to explain my actions.
- So they, when i was- i don't know- about 11 or 12 years old, i had someone of an existential crisis because it just doesn't seem to be any meaning in the world, like i said, no meaning to life.
- And so i actually read all the religious texts and obviously going to understand these things well enough to have an existential crisis comes up with other value of everyone who's made in the image of god.
- It's something like that.
- But the third thing is, once you do those two things, you can concentrate on the moment.
- See, you're not seems to be even technically, you can think about this- neuropsychological.
- So if you're looking for meaning, meaning is a form of incentive, reward and incentive reward is stupid.
- Mediated and incentive reward occurs in relationship to advancement towards a goal, which is a form of entropy minimization as it turns out of something: alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
- Well, negative emotions signifies the emergence of entropy.
- Positive emotion on the dopamine signals: it's reduction.
- But there's something that's more complex there, because the higher the goal that you're trying to attain- intrinsic value each step towards it comprises, and that's neuropsychological accurate, and so part of the wisdom of the sermon on the mount is that if you pause it, the highest imaginable goal than any step towards it is the captures.
- Your attention is also deeply meaningful, and so that's an answer to what the meaning is of process, rather than say something like 42 and you said- it seems to me that you were intimidating- that your discovery through adams, that the question was the thing, was to the resolution of your existential crisis.
- Okay, so that's part of the reason that you're motivated to say building, to understand what i was about.
- Okay, well, i'm just going to accept that we are ignorant of a great many things and we should be less ignorant, and anything we can do that will improve our understanding of the universe and make us less ignorant and have a deeper understanding of the universe and even more questions to answer, to ask about the answer that is universe, which is, i think, adams central point is good, and so that was good and so like.
- Is this a religion?
- I don't know, maybe it is, but i think it's a good one.
- Period.
- The ancient god of the mesopotamians- his name- was the best defense attorney.
- He was literally play the mesopotamians.
- He was the agent that revitalized the tyrannical state and overcame evil, and also the force that dispensed with chaos and built something magnificent and cosmic out of it.
- Right?
- So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They asked him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been a good attendance and speaking properly in the previous message.
- If you don't use that vision, if each citizen doesn't use that vision, it's replaced by the totalitarian, all-seeing eye, right, right, so that's a hell of a thing to know.
- Okay, so that, okay, so that's cool.
- So i wonder, i see, i see, cuz i wondered what motivated you, cuz you pushing so many directions simultaneously.
- You have to be really highly motivated to do that, and so you figured out that the question, in a sense, was the answer.
- The question, and a better understanding of the universe is something that we can continue to do as a civilization for a very long time.
- Yeah, yeah, like forever, so that's okay.
- On things that improve our understanding of the universe at a base level.
- Well, this is why i actually think we want to population increase, because population increase means that there are more people- that we've expanded the scale, yeah, we've expanded the scale of consciousness, of consciousness, so that there's something of marks.
- And he went and looked at mark's poetry and drama that he wrote before he wrote the communist manifesto and he found out something very interesting.
- He found out that marks- his favorite quote from bertha was a statement by mephistopheles.
- It's a very specific statement and it's a very motivation.
- So lucifer's motivation is predicated on this argument.
- Said: consciousness is nothing but consciousness of pain and misery.
- Life is short and brutal and pointless.
- Therefore, it would be better if consciousness itself was eradicated.
- Understand that life without social order would degenerated into that.
- But the memphis, tennessee, it is the very definition of crazy right now, the definition of the adversarial spirit.
- Now, let's say, is that that's wrong in the consciousness should be so.
- Then we say: so why should consciousness be expanded if it's nothing but consciousness of suffering?
- And your answer: lots of people suffer, like slots, an existential crisis.
- So it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's an obviously false statement that life is really so one of the things i've tried to do is to understand- so like there are a limited number of things that are.
- But i was very close with with larry page, is one of my best friends and in fact, i'd stay at his house because i've spent half the week in the bay area running tesla, in half in la running spacex and, and for the longest time i never even had a house in the area.
- I would just stay at friends, friends places that spare room.
- I stay there if they didn't have to sleep on the couch and and i find, actually i didn't have a house for more than a decade road to catch up with friends and, and so i would have these conversations with our page long into the night about increasingly concerned that he was not sufficiently concerned about ai safety and i want point.
- He did call me a species- yes, you are one.
- Yes, yes, i guess, correctly labeled- like the other people and everyone will just be robots, yeah, and for a while, the price of our intrinsic limitations, and that is a difficult, bitter, let's say, pill to swallow.
- But i also think so.
- I thought recently: you know, how do you know that something's real?
- Say: death makes things real.
- Death makes things real.
- And so if you, if you eradicate death, it seems to me that in some fundamental level you also eradicate reality itself.
- So i don't know, because i think you really could evolve human evolution.
- It's better for organisms to have a finite life and death.
- Death brings renewal, essentially, and i think we do need to be cautious about trying to solve longevity in a love forever type sense, because i think our, our society, our culture would ossify and the people in power would always remain in power.
- You know, if you had said 10,000 year span of consciousness with no sleep, i don't know what the hell you'd be if that was who you were, but you would be human.
- And then we also don't understand that.
- See, part of the problem, i think, with the perspective that the technology to human existence is that there's a reductionism there.
- That's something.
- It's something like there's no difference between us and the gist of our linguistic network, something like that, like whatever we are is conscious of a lot deeper than the patterns of what make up our cortical existence.
- Consciousness is way deeper than cortical existence.
- And maybe i do think you have to sort of this question of where, where does consciousness arise?
- Traditional christian, but it drives many more cells, eventually reaching to an adult human has 30 to 40 trillion cells.
- So where, where, where?
- Where does is it?
- Where is consciousness right?
- Does it grow slowly?
- Is there a step change?
- And you know, i tend to generally believed in physics and you seem to have done pretty well, and everything else is a recommendation.
- So if you, if you have beliefs that are incompatible with a rocket, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right now is a host judge, that's definitely, definitely.
- Do you think he's llms like?
- Do you think that any of the machinery that you've interacted with is showing anything, signs of anything that might be equated to consciousness?
- Mineola, limbs are remarkable, right in, they certainly pass the turing test as far as i'm concerned, period tokens, and those tokens are more than one letter, and so it actually really it's.
- It's my office with respect to single letters.
- Go to resolution problem.
- Yeah, yeah, you can get around with this with like weird tricks, like if you have to write a computer program to count the number of letters in a word, it can create that computer program, run it and then and then get the number of letters correct.
- Right now is nothing conscious potentially, and i think you want to, just when you're trying to understand something, consider the various possible answers, and i think that there's a probability associated with each one of these answers.
- Now, if physics is correct, universe started off with and that that coalesced into stars, that exploded when a car, less than stars, you had the formation of heavier elements and and then those dogs have scattered and then reformed and made new stars and so eventually got elements that are higher in the periodic table besides the ones.
- Yeah, so this is, this is what physics- consciousness.
- Well, yeah, so the point is that the universe- and give it enough time, you have more, your complex heavy elements and will, complex molecules, and and then, 13.8 billion years later, at least on this planet, we have what we call consciousness in the form, you know, but that means consciousness had to arise from hydrogen.
- I've seen your comments to the same sort of thing that my friend jonathan has been trying to elucidate: structure of possibility.
- He associates with the concept of heaven, like there's an implicit structure of possibility that material forms are trying to flush out.
- The possibility of consciousness is inherent in the hydrogen atoms?
- Right, obviously, because representations.
- You have three fundamental elements.
- You have something like order which you can think about is society, but it's it's the, it's the, a prairie, axiomatic interpretive structure.
- You have that.
- Then you have chaotic potential.
- That's the tofu that exists at the beginning of time, and so the way god is represented in the story of genesis is that.
- So god is the a priori interpretive process that gives rise to order as a consequence of manipulating potential, and the intermediary factor is the word.
- That's the christian conception, and the word is something like the sacrificial gesture.
- That's that's necessary for learning to take place.
- So you can imagine this: when you learn something, it's not only that you add to a storehouse that you have, it's that something that you already know has to undergo a death and a transformational.
- Most real learning is painful.
- You think about it.
- More chaos is associated with that can be exciting, but it can also be destabilizing, not existential crisis- that you have had great potential.
- It was without its pain, right?
- So if you imagine the axiom hierarchy go, the more chaos is released when that actually was challenged.
- You get a negative national response to that with his anxiety and threat, because god only knows what happens when all hell breaks loose.
- But there's a positive aspect too.
- That's why it's a dragon and a treasure always in the hero mythology.
- It's because when all hell breaks loose there's a man's opportunity.
- And so, and that's part of the meaning.
- Now i think you capitalize on that treasure, let's say on the treasure portion of that chaos, by assuming something like your own ignorance, by allowing your initial preconceptions to die and by tracking the trail of deep and insistent questioning.
- So now you, your questioning, took the place.
- If i got it right, you basically took the scientific fact.
- Is that right?
- Because i'm trying to send a truth, the truth of the universe, and physics is essentially study of the truth of the universe, at least those things that are predictable.
- Existential crisis, which happened about the same time years did i started.
- I didn't study science precisely, i wasn't as interested in the transformations of the material world, so i'm probably more people-oriented than thing oriented temperamentally.
- So i started study evil.
- That was my delving into the depths, because i wanted to crack that.
- I want to understand, if not so much because i became consistent with that very quickly.
- But what exactly that had to do with me?
- Cuz when i was reading history tomorrow i try to understand the rise and fall of civilizations, and what do you think makes them fall?
- Or one of the things is a decreasing birth rate, which seems to be a natural consequence of prosperity.
- As far as i know, that is experience, population of the emergence, something like a, a nonstick egocentrism.
- Well, examples of civilizations prosperous: there is generally a trend towards hedonism.
- Well, you can get away with it if you're worth it, because the consequences of exactly precisely so you know if you're, if you're a civilization.
- Who was in the varieties of religious experience?
- And that really had an effect on me, because i think that you need something akin to an existential threat in order to set you straight.
- I think there's some truth about you know, it's like if it's a, if it's a spoiled child, that were everything he or she wants and you have sort of a veruca salt is a civilization.
- I think it's the right way to think about it.
- Developmentally, a neuropsychology, because maturation itself consists of two processes.
- Let's say, i am, the more i'm bringing other people into the purview of my vision, so i extend myself across other people.
- Be my family first, but then brought the community more broadly.
- The better you aren't that?
- The more people you can play a game with at the same time.
- But you also do the same thing with the future, and that's actually, as far as i can tell, what the cortex is, for it's to move you away from primordial, hedonistic motivation to this morning inclusive sense of future and community right, and that's higher order self, and so the default would be immaturity.
- And wealth can obviously facilitate that, and maybe it's partly because- okay, so you're a very wealthy man, you can give your children anything they ever ask for, fights, and a father who is a difficult creature.
- To continue, and are you grateful for it or are you unhappy about it?
- I guess you never know the things that really made you who you are today.
- So, at the end of the day, am i on netflix for my life?
- I am.
- I'm leaving the rough details of your childhood: a lot of physical nations and a lot of- i don't know exactly what i mean.
- I was almost beaten to death within an inch of my life at one point location.
- About that, cuz that's a pathway that people take.
- I think that people do take the path of vengeance and justify it by recourse to the reality of their own suffering.
- So the story of joke, one of the things i concluded from the story of joke, because it's a precursor to the.
- The first decision is that, no matter how terrible things become for him, he will not lose faith in himself.
- And the second is: no matter what horrors are visited on him by satan himself, he will not lose faith in the- what would you say?
- In the spirit that gave rise to the cosmic order.
- Right, no matter what?
- Well, so you know why i'm not a particularly religious person.
- The teachings of jesus are good, and why is, and that there's tremendous wisdom.
- And turn the other cheek, and for a while, that's really a week.
- Yeah, i think you should turn the others with them, but they need to stop stop playing.
- You know, make peace.
- Christianity proclamation or admission that if you compare different societies and their axiomatic suppositions, he would prefer the ones predicated on christianity assumptions, and i do think those are good ones.
- Okay, so, okay, so.
- So.
- That's why i asked you the question about why you would consider yourself not a religious person, because it seems to me that the essence of it isn't, it isn't the statement that you abide by a particular protestant creed, let's say, it seems to be much more akin to the notion that you believe that this set of axiomatic positions is, like the name society: the greatest happiness for humanity.
- What's the weather in?
- In, in, in, hungry.
- Down by 38% with no compulsion right.
- They have a 12-week limit of hungary.
- Yeah, they've increased the proportion of women in the labor force by about 15%.
- They've knocked the divorce rate down substantially and, at minimum, they've decreased the decline in the birth rate.
- I don't know if they've actually managed to tilt it back up and hungry yet, but they spend about 7% of their gdp on family policy and this ark enterprise we've been building in london made family policy a center point.
- We're trying to bring classic conservatives and liberals together all around the world and you know you're thinking on that need.
- A list front is actually being what would you say is being an input into that, because i started to notice- well, i don't know, i don't think it was 20 years ago that i was, it was, it was not that long ago, but i knew that there was something terribly wrong with the fact that it's so terribly in south korean, japan.
- I think so simple way to do it is say how many babies were born last year and what is the average lifespan in that country, and that that and then if, if that birth rate, if that number of babies stays constant, then eventually the old people will die and that will be the population of the country.
- It's very straightforward: alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
- So if you want to say japan, which i think had a lot of 800,000 books last year, and then you multiply that by the lifespan, which is around 8 or 85 years, you get to a population of 60 to 70 million range, which is massive decrease from 100 million.
- It seems to me the combination of that lack of engagement on the relationship of profound immortalization, because people, according to the desert, stupidly, we were better off in the tyranny.
- There's no way we're going to survive, right, and the next scouts or the other set of scouts, caleb and joshua, come back and say: well, there's trouble there, but if we aim up and we get our act together, we can turn this into the promised land.
- Okay, it's at that point that god condemns moses to die and aaron, who's the political wing, and the earth opens up and swallows up the face of the scouts.
- And it's the people who are led by caleb and joshua- who has the same name as christ, by the way, and that's relevant- they're the ones that are led into the promised land.
- Okay, so what's the meaning of the story?
- Well, the future is always a challenge and the moral thing to do is to advance in the future regardless.
- In some ways, it's a weird thing, cuz it's kind of regardless of the data, because you can say, well, look at all the suffering that constitutes of the future, and certainly people do hesitate about bringing a child, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, and it's weird because you had to bring a child into the world and you had to pick a time.
- You probably pick this one, and so obviously everybody who had a child, at least by choice, in the past, did that in spite of the catastrophe of the future.
- But sorry, it's a long-winded way of making a point- there's an ethical requirement that's associated with living in the manner that would justify your life, even to yourself: to have faith and courage in the future, no matter what.
- Right, so it's not against death anxiety directions.
- I have a 12, 12, so you're definitely doing your part.
- What do you like about kids?
- What do you like about kids?
- I mean, there's an older version of okay, so it's quite a big difference- of the youngest, he's full and my, my older boys are 20 and 17218 shortly.
- So what did you like about?
- What's the weather outside?
- The people you'll ever meet in your life, who want nothing more than to have the best possible relationship they could have with anyone, with you?
- That's a good deal and i think there's.
- You know, if we want biologically inclined to love our children and to one another, to them and find reward, we would long ago have to exist.
- I mean, you can take, say, i don't know, a wolf or a wildcat or something, something, and when that creature has babies, the mother earth hedonistic approach to life.
- I think there's an appeal, even on the hedonism side, to say that, well, what do you not?
- You'll actually find it very rewarding.
- I think that's good.
- That's good appeal and it's one.
- That's why i think it's a solid argument that people have kids.
- I had a very busy job and i pretty much stopped doing everything except my job and spending time with my kids.
- But if i had to drink those in importance and spending time with my kids, yeah, that was better.
- And if your kids are capable of a modicum of pro-social behavior, which is pretty much your choice, although it makes a difference, there isn't anyone more entertaining to associate with the little kids because apparently i think it's because they're not as cortically inhibited.
- So my daughter has no filter.
- Filter.
- I do think that and i consider myself an environmentalist, but i think the environmental movement has gone too far, and it's going too far in the sense that the internet, front vortex, evolved so that we can produce disposable avatars, right.
- So i in our conversation, what i'm really doing in our conversation is i'm offering you a potential avatar of myself for the future and i'm saying: why don't you see if you can kill this thing now, so i don't have to act it out and die?
- And that's part of the right, exactly, and so, and we've extended that with games, for example, that, and so the reason- the biologists, because they don't actually understand the qualitative difference between human beings and other creatures- is that we can let our thoughts die instead of us.
- We, so that substitutionary death, that's a good way of thinking about it, right, and that means that the mouth- i don't like the idea of natural- absolutely are everything else: freshwater, that is not a natural resource, and kerosene or fossil fuel just laid in the ground until like 1850 because nobody can figure out what the hell to do with it.
- So, so what that implies is that it's something.
- I think it's a religious ethos, that's the natural resource, the religiously thoughts, that allows us to orient to the future, to be community-oriented and to and to be trustworthy.
- Yeah, well, at least somebody apply physics or analyzed in a scientific way, to say, is how many humans can sustain without most people consider to be significant environmental damage, and i think, if you actually do the numbers, i think it's potentially 10 times the population.
- Since the mid-1960s, the moral proclamation has been that there are too many people on the planet, and that is, i think paul ehrlich was the ultimate.
- What exponent of that picture is.
- Analysis was very unscientific, erased on some visit to deli, i believe.
- Right, right, sort of nonsense.
- Do we need to grow food?
- How much would that have?
- What's the actual potential?
- Right, and we are actually quite good at it.
- Right, right, right.
- And is there enough water?
- Well, actually, it's very inexpensive.
- So this is surface area and an energy to to grow food and time, and increasingly, there's no shortage right now.
- It's energy dependent to some degree, yeah, but the energy problem is solvable.
- So let's turn to practice your as well.
- So let's start with with open youtube because, well, his, his view is that we'll all be essentially upload on my, the computers and then humans.
- They won't really be a need for humans.
- And i thought that was.
- I was like what team are you online?
- Right, right, and i said we really need to make sure humanity thrives and grows and and, and, and, and.
- Then he called me a species for saying that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So i'm like, well, i guess i am human.
- And i was like, okay, we really need some company turn off.
- The great i research is.
- They had massive computing power, mass of financial resources and it was very much a unipolar world with respect to ai and unipolar world controlled by larry page and and who you know had i thought so much.
- So that was the basis for creating company.
- Like insufficiently concerned with humans, that's that's a problem, yes, and has all the way so that that that that would be the opposite of of google- would be a non-profit that is open source, so you can see what's going on- not a black box, incentives to make as much money as possible so openly.
- I started as a as a non-profit, open source, the open and opening hours to open something.
- So why were you concerned about the prophet of warping things?
- And at that point at least.
- I think this is particularly a challenge for publicly traded companies.
- You just get sued if you don't maximize profits.
- You know that somebody else directions, not with brock, yeah.
- So maybe that's the solution, rather like right, sure, the last thing you need is another like immense legal battle- i mean i'm still considering illegal challenge- to at least have to have the court explain to me how an organization that i founded for one purpose can do the diametrically opposed purpose and become a for-profit.
- Please just show me the trailer.
- What day of ingested the woke my virus in the training?
- You can see some of that in the end of the output results.
- Know, that was really something.
- That was really something to say.
- That was like a jaw on the floor moment and then asking questions like: is you know which one's worse?
- Do you, are you shocked at the fact that you're donating a substantial amount of money to facilitate trump selection?
- Is that something you would have believed in the realm of possibility, say, 5 years ago?
- Well, and i want to hear california.
- No money in the system then would otherwise be possible.
- The democrat and republican side, yes, and i actually.
- What are you hoping to accomplish with this?
- And what's the pack called america america, could you elucidate?
- Yes, yes, so you know.
- One of them is being a meritocracy: as much, as much of them, as much of a meritocracy as possible, such that you get ahead as a function of your hard work and your skill and nothing else, which is, for example, is nepotism and dynasty absolutely has its price.
- Meritocracy promoting a freedom: freedom to operate, meaning like the least amount of, of, of, of, of government intervention possible.
- We want- and this is, i think, it's important to fight as, because the natural tendency over time- so that was like entropy- is that the hand of government regulations accumulate.
- So that's the evil of the king.
- A very, very old story.
- Very good, wrestling with that problem 4000 years ago.
- Right, yeah, so you have to have some.
- You have to really have to take an active role in reducing the number of regulations of past.
- Eventually, everything terms by the government that if we hired anyone who is not a permanent resident of the united states, have either green card or a citizen, that i would go to prison, because the presumption of somebody is not a permanent resident is that they will leave the united states and take the rocket technology for spacex to potentially to countries that would cause harm to the united states.
- And then a few years ago, the biden administration decided to spacex for failing to hire asylum seekers.
- Right, right, yeah, i remember that, i remember that.
- So we're talking about, right well, the purpose.
- You don't need to make damn sure that you're damned correct.
- Right, right, and and and and and why does administration department?
- You know, i don't know if it could just be random, it could be.
- I didn't tell us, you know why, because, why, why, why, why do such a crazy lawsuits?
- Even if it is random, that's still bad, but if it's not random, well, it seems like so much.
- And the democratic party in the us is fundamentally controlled by the unions, so i'm speculating here.
- But since, since the factory floor, so that's really exciting.
- That's a real opportunity for people.
- What do you think of trump?
- Well, i mean, i'm not going to you, so for me it's really just got a choice of administration's and we we have to pick one, and i think both their clothes on, and he's a complicated person.
- I've been trying to figure him out because some of the things that look like flaws might be advantageous in disguise.
- Like he seems to me pretty good.
- It's standing up to psychopathic bullies, for example, and that's kind of a useful skill, and it's not easy.
- You have to be a bit of a monster to manage that, and it isn't obvious to me how many of the- even the divisive idiosyncrasies of trump are the mirror image of his capacity to stand up to bullies, and that's a tough call, man.
- So you obviously decided to lay your efforts down on the side of the trump administration.
- In the fourth company was the party of america.
- Yeah, and these days that party on so, so weirdly, the.
- In my view, the republican party is actually the party of that.
- That's the, the meritocracy party, cuz you know the democrats also promoting dui, which is really just another form of racism and sexism.
- America credit.
- So then write the primary.
- What would you say?
- Conceptual distinction between individuals, yes, yes, i think the evidence has made things much more.
- When my kids grew up, i would say they were racist.
- Ethnicity and gender blind.
- Siri, play with the san francisco.
- It's a really ugly thing to see.
- So, yeah, not good, not good, yeah.
- So my view and it is that at this point in the united states, the republican party is more in line with meritocracy and with personal freedom.
- So i never had a conservative many times with my left wing friends, let's say they refuse to talk to someone- me included, definition- for a very long time, and i've got like absolutely nowhere with that.
- They'll talk to me in private, they will not talk to me in public, and so that's.
- That's never happened.
- On the republican side, i found it much easier because talk to a lot of democrats and a lot of republicans, and i found it much, much easier to talk to the republicans, and that is somewhat of a shark.
- I wouldn't have necessarily expected that.
- Yeah, and i should be clear that i said like: i think the republican party is flawless.
- It certainly isn't.
- It's got its issues.
- There are extremists within the republican party that i don't agree with, but one has its a two-party system.
- America needs a strong leader and with that we have the perception of strength.
- Now you have to admire that trump.
- After getting shot with blood streaming down his face, it could have been a second shooter, who knows?
- Nonetheless, you know i mean this is not funny.
- I think they are a pack of contemptible cowards and i think that everyone who's been involved in this in relationship to minors should go to prison.
- Okay, okay, okay, why do you agree?
- What like what?
- What?
- What's your?
- Or in the water.
- In this particular, this is the worst medical and psychological malpractice i've ever seen anywhere, including what i've done, what i've studied in reference to historical atrocity eugenics- what do you call those?
- Prefrontal lobotomy, even the sorts of things that we're going on in nazi germany- at least the bloody nazis new it was wrong and tried to hide it.
- So, okay, so what?
- What's your?
- What's your?
- Why are you engaged in this particular battle?
- Mean, you said you're going to move a couple of your company headquarters out of california because of the last legislative with regards to the transition.
- So yes, i mean yes, and i was like, look, it's not that, it's, the wine store is just the final straw, that's okay.
- I've had conversations with before where i said if you, if you pass, legislation is out of california and you that, ahead of time, cancel, ok, google.
- The reality is that almost every child goes through some kind of identity crisis.
- You know exactly, it's just part of growing up.
- If so, it's very possible for for adults to manipulate children into who are having a natural identity crisis, into believing that they are the wrong gender and the other gender, and then they give them sterilizing drugs.
- Yeah, it's macabre, and we have an age of consent for a reason that the reason you can't get, say, tattoos at age 18, or drink or drive.
- You know, i wish you can do things because if we allow children 1, 0, 1, 2, 4, where i was, i was actually tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, xavier.
- This is before i had really understanding what was going on in the covid going on.
- And so there was a lot of confusion and you know, i was told no reliable clinician ever believed that.
- There was never any evidence for that.
- And also, if there's a higher suicide rate, the reason is because of the underlying depression and anxiety and not because of the gender dysphoria, and every goddamn clinician knows that too and they're too cowardly to come out and say it right and so that.
- And then we end up in exactly when i saw that propagation: agree to this radical transformation, that their children are going to die, and you think that's moral and you think that's true, that's so.
- That is so pathological that it's almost incomprehensible.
- I can't imagine anything worse.
- I can't imagine the therapist doing anything worse than that, or sitting by idling, remaining silent while his colleagues are doing it.
- It's pathetic, it's incredibly evil and i agree with you that people that have been promoting this should go to prison.
- It won't stop until that happens.
- Yeah, it'll just go underground.
- There's all puberty blockers are being accessed online by kidz bop channels.
- So, yeah, it's not going to stop, okay, so i see, so that's right.
- It wasn't explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs.
- So, anyway, and so i lost my son, essentially.
- So you know they, they call it for a reason.
- It's because your son is dead.
- So my son, xavier, is dead, killed by the woke, my virus.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I can't imagine the club.
- Okay, let's end on something positive.
- You're shooting for mars.
- What do you think that's doing for people, cuz it's kind of i don't want to be, i don't want to step out of my box here, but it's.
- It's really interesting to me to watch you do this because it's preposterous, right, it's a preposterous thing to do to go to mars.
- And yet i was old enough when the moon landing was happening to remember what that was like.
- Right, it was an adventure, positive adventure, everybody could, and it was an unbelievable technological.
- What do you think you're doing with this, with the mars venture?
- I think is part of the expansion of consciousness.
- I don't think we should apply some vast number amount of resources to to mars.
- I'm talking about less than 1% of our economic output should go to making life multi-planet, but it is a natural extension of expanding the scope of scale of consciousness.
- So i think we want to do everything we can to make sure that earth is going to be great for a long time, as long as possible, and but also allocate a small amount of resources to extending life beyond earth and and ultimately to other star systems.
- Right, and so that's.
- That's perfectly in keeping with what you described at the beginning meaning of the of our discussion, about the manner in which you resolved your crisis of it as a child, your commitment to the validity of consciousness, your, your desire to what would you say facilitated transformation, development, extension.
- That goes along with your pro-human ethos, right?
- So that's all thinking from first principles.
- So i think you are stuck in the religious camp.
- One word other so i can say that i don't mind, but i think so i want to end with this, if you don't mind.
- So i also asked you why you trust yourself in relationship to answer, but i mean more broadly: like you have a lot of admirers, there's a lot of people who are hoping that you're the guy, that you, what would you say?
- That you're the guy who can do what you say you're going to do.
- There's lots of evidence that you can.
- It's like you think it's reasonable for people to trust you.
- Well, i think so.
- I mean, i wouldn't say trust me, but i think, on balance, my track record suggests that i'm barely trustworthy.
- What elements of it do you think suggest that particularly well?
- I've built a lot of companies that have been useful things.
- Yeah, right now- and you accept the validity of entrepreneurial- i wouldn't be able to recruit people to work with me- to movies, i think, if i was like a really bad person.
- So you know, i think, like one of the tests for you know, assessing someone's character is to look at the character of their friends and their associates, and while people can put up a mask themselves for their character, their friends and associates will not, and so you can charge it, charge a person's character by the princess associate.
- Thank you all right, thank you very much appreciated.
- Very good to talk to you.
- It was real privilege.
- So the first thing i'd like to say is that it's ridiculously exciting to be here.
- This is quite the amazing place and i've been preparing to talk to you for a long time, so i'm really looking forward to it.
- You said something that caught me right away when we were discussing various issues.
- Just before we started, you said you were up till 4:00 in the morning to start up training in 19 days, which is the fastest that anyone has ever gotten a super computer.
- Tell me what you think about this.
- Also, there's a golden thread of conversation that constitutes the basis for humanity's education, let's say.
- That's run across centuries and, in principle, those with that concentrates on ideas that have been winnowed, probably through a quasi evolutionary process across large spans of time, to get documents out of that, like the well, like the king james bible, for example, and there's zeroing in on core conceptual structures that we don't even necessarily explicitly understand.
- It seems to me that when we take young people and we give them a genuine humanity's education, we saw the alignment problem for them now, so the question is not transmitted.
- So this next to something that's very essential, which is: well, what's the difference that say, or is there a difference between the western canon, let's say in the latest woke nonsense?
- Now, i've used draw a lot and it's not as well as chat, gpt, but it's still woke like, it's still deviation.
- So so how are you, can you address that?
- By it's just a language model at the moment, let's say if it also understood images, if it was supposed to behavior.
- Ok, google, i've been wondering.
- I know tesla's a car company, but when i look at work, well, maybe more like those are cars, those are autonomous robots, robots, robots.
- So what advantage do you have, given that you have all this real world out of that you've gathered from your automobile?
- So we really need, we have a lot of catching up to do to companies that have been around for 5:10, from getting hardware installation to it, beginning training was only 19 days and that's the fastest by far that anyone's been able to do that.
- So we're moving quickly, but we still catching up.
- And so if you use up to gemini clothes, how do you feel that fast?
- How do you feel the rock performance in relationship to now?
- Well, so the garage version, the foundation model of of rock, is still an order of magnitude weaker than chesapeake.
- So it's quite well, given that order of magnitude of difference, to actually finished training with roughly probably finish training in about 3 or 4 months, and then there'll be some fine-tuning and bug fixing- what not- and we're hoping to release rock 3 by december and it's got three- should be the most powerful ai in the world.
- At that point- i have worked with lots of undergraduates and graduates with chachi pt- is, if you can corner it into behaving properly, that you kind of have something approximating a team of, i would say, masters, degree level intelligence and something like that.
- What are you envisioned for this new?
- Well, let's say, the new york three?
- And then you talked about delving deeper into this structure of the universe, and you are a remarkably forward-looking person.
- So what do you?
- What the hell do you think you're building with these systems?
- Like, what is this?
- What i think amityville is digital, digital superintelligence, so, and intelligence thus far smarter than any any human, and then, ultimately, an intelligence that is far smarter than all humans combined.
- No one can say like, is this a wise thing to do?
- Isn't this, isn't it?
- Well, unfortunately, we have a choice of being a spectator or a participant.
- But that's life period.
- Why do you?
- Why, okay, so why do you trust yourself on that front?
- Just out of me, that's an important question about myself, or directions to the others are going, i think, trained to be politically correct, and the work my virus is woven in throughout them.
- I'm sure you've seen that.
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.
- You know, my students used to ask me when i cuz i've been teaching what i've been teaching for about 40 years, and one of the questions they used to ask me is how i knew that what i was teaching wasn't just another ideology, right, cuz the postmodern take is: well, all it is is a plethora of power games, and so there's no rain quartering approaches to the truth in terms of their ethical suitability, but that's not the game that you're playing right now.
- I think you can look at like: likely enhance or decrease enlightenment.
- Will any given belief system improve our understanding of the universe?
- Will we learn more things?
- Will we achieve a deeper understanding of physics, and so that's grounded, at least in part, in a scientific framework, from the sounds of it, i mean.
- I think there are facts about the world.
- There are things that are extremely is about 99.99% to be true.
- You can run experiments: 1% volume, probability of being true or untrue, or probability of being relevant to an argument or not relevant to.
- Not going to be just talking about the basics of of coaches here, yeah, yeah, okay, so let me, let me put it on that too.
- So one of the things that really struck me about your public pronouncements in recent years was your insistence that we're in a natal crisis and that that's actually a problem, because it's actually true.
- Well, it depends whether you think that the planet would be better off if it was the population.
- So what?
- Ok, google 1880 was trying to get my finger on that.
- There was a recent research article published on this too, and he needed lists- are much more likely to show dark red traits: machiavellian, psychopathic, narcissistic and sadistic, because those first three weren't enough right, and so those things are tightly aligned, especially the best predictor with psychopathy for being an antinatalist.
- Sure, alright, alright, well, in the past are very, very, very, very very self-centered, right, it's like overgrown two year olds, overgrown aggressive 2 year old.
- So that's not good.
- How did you start to understand that the one of the fundamental ethical problems is different than the scientific problem?
- One of the fundamental ethical problems that's playing the west is this catastrophically low birth rate of 20 + 0.34, extrapolating any demographic of.
- But if you, if i, was preface by saying: if these trends continue, most countries will, will dwindle into insignificance, they might completely die out.
- So i'm thinking about that in relationship to sacred images of masculinity in the west is chris fiction, but a man isn't a woman.
- The sacred image of a woman is a woman and an infant, right?
- So chris images, the feminine is conceptualized as the combination of female and infant- than the culture has lost its attachment to the traditional sacred images and is probably on its way out.
- Yeah, i think there is an argumentative and in a way it's an attempt to solve the alignment problem.
- Okay, so there's a unity of moral purpose, that that is conceptualized in the traditional.
- What should be put in the highest place?
- So it's god in in the final analysis.
- Its ineffable, but it is a fundamental uni, unification, monotheism.
- Okay.
- Now here is a hypothesis.
- When that collapses, two things arise to replace it.
- Okay, one is this driving for power, and the other is the untrammeled- what would you call it?
- The untrammeled dominion of hedonism, and especially on the sexual gratification side.
- So it's like, if there's no ultimate unity that's future and community-oriented, that's predicated on sacrifice, you get a dissolution immediately into the next two contenders for domination.
- And one is: it's about me, buddy, and get the hell out of the way.
- And aligned with that is not only is it about me, it's about me what would you say something to my most?
- Because why would i want power except to do exactly what the hell i want whenever i want to?
- And so part of the problem with the idea of people like talking, so dawkins, long, yeah, yeah.
- And then you also did publicly proclaim it at a time when the insistence, the moral insistence, was all on the side of you know jane goodall's pronouncements that if we don't reduce the population of the planet dramatically, that the nature goddess is going to be upset, which is also a very, very old idea, not a very good one.
- So so i'm very curious about your intuition there, like that's a long time ago.
- And so how did you caught on to the fact that that antagonistic attitude towards birth that's embedded in our culture now with something that should be called out and that was pathological?
- Well, i mean, i should go back to what is the foundation of, because you know to explain my actions.
- So they, when i was- i don't know- about 11 or 12 years old, i had someone of an existential crisis because it just doesn't seem to be any meaning in the world, like i said, no meaning to life.
- And so i actually read all the religious texts and obviously going to understand these things well enough to have an existential crisis, comes up with other value of everyone who's made in the image of god.
- It's something like that.
- But the third thing is, once you do those two things, you can concentrate on the moment.
- See, you're not seems to be even technically.
- You can think about this neuropsychological.
- So, if you're looking for meaning, meaning is a form of incentive reward, and incentive reward is stupid, mediated, and incentive reward occurs in relationship to advancement towards a goal, which is a form of entropy minimization, as it turns out, of something: alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
- Well, negative emotions signifies the emergence of entropy.
- Positive emotion on the dopamine signals, it's reduction.
- But there's something that's more complex there, because the higher the goal that you're trying to attain intrinsic value each step towards it comprises, and that's neuropsychological accurate, and so part of the wisdom of the sermon on the mount is that if you pause it, the highest imaginable goal than any step towards it is the captures your attention is also deeply meaningful, and so that's an answer to what the meaning is of process, rather than say something like 42 and you said- it seems to me that you were intimidating- that your discovery through adams, that the question was the thing was to the resolution of your existential crisis.
- Okay, so that's part of the reason that you're motivated to say building to understand what i was about.
- Okay, well, i'm just going to accept that we are ignorant of a great many things and we should be less ignorant and anything we can do that will improve our understanding of the universe and make us less ignorant and have a deeper understanding of the universe and even more questions to answer, to ask about the answer that is universe, which is, i think, adams central point is good, and so that was good, and so like.
- Is this a religion?
- I don't know, maybe it is, but i think it's a good one.
- Period, the ancient god of the mesopotamians- his name was the best defense attorney.
- He was literally play the mesopotamians.
- He was the agent that revitalized the tyrannical state and overcame evil, and also the force that dispensed with chaos and built something magnificent and cosmic out of it.
- Right, so, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They asked him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been a good attendance and speaking properly in the previous message.
- If you don't use that vision.
- If each citizen doesn't use that vision, it's replaced by the totalitarian all-seeing eye.
- Right, right, so that's a hell of a thing to know.
- Okay, so that, okay, so that's cool.
- So i wonder, i see, i see, cuz i wondered what motivated you, cuz you pushing so many directions simultaneously- you have to be really highly motivated to do that- and so you figured out that the question, in a sense, was the answer.
- The question and a better understanding of the universe is something that we can continue to do as a civilization for a very long time, yeah, yeah, like forever.
- So that's okay.
- On things that improve our understanding of the universe at a base level, well, this is why i actually think we want to population increase, because population increase means that there are more people- that we've expanded the scale, yeah, we've expanded the scale of consciousness, of consciousness, so that there's something of marks.
- And he went and looked at mark's poetry and drama that he wrote before he wrote the communist manifesto and he found out something very interesting.
- He found out that marks- his favorite quote from bertha was a statement by mephistopheles.
- It's a very specific statement and it's a very motivation.
- So lucifer's motivation is predicated on this argument.
- Said, consciousness is nothing but consciousness of pain and misery.
- Life is short and brutal and pointless.
- Therefore, it would be better if consciousness itself was eradicated.
- Understand that life without social order would degenerated into that.
- But the memphis, tennessee, it is the very definition of crazy right now.
- The definition of the adversarial spirit now, let's say, is that that's wrong in the consciousness should be so.
- Then we say so.
- Why should consciousness be expanded if it's nothing but consciousness of suffering?
- And your answer: lots of people suffer like slots, an existential crisis.
- So it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's an obviously false statement that life is really so.
- One of the things i've tried to do is to understand.
- So like there are a limited number of things that are.
- But i was very close with with larry page is one of my best friends and in fact i'd stay at his house because i've spent half the week in the bay area running tesla, in half in la running spacex and, and for the longest time i never even had a house in the area.
- I would just stay at friends, friends places, that spare room.
- I stay there if they didn't have to sleep on the couch and- and i find actually i didn't have a house for more than a decade road to catch up with friends, and and so i would have these conversations with our page long into the night about increasingly concerned that he was not sufficiently concerned about ai safety.
- And i want point, he did call me a species- yes, you are one.
- Yes, yes, i guess, correctly labeled- like the other people and everyone will just be robots.
- Yeah, and for a while.
- The price of our intrinsic limitations.
- And that is a difficult, bitter, let's say, pill to swallow.
- But i also think so.
- I thought recently: you know, how do you know that something's real?
- Say: death makes things real, death makes things real.
- And so if you, if you eradicate death, it seems to me that in some fundamental level, you also eradicate reality itself.
- So i don't know, because i think you really could evolve human evolution.
- It's better for organisms to have a finite life and death.
- Death brings renewal, essentially, and i think we do need to be cautious about trying to solve longevity in a love forever type sense, because i think our, our society, our culture would ossify and the people in power would always remain in power.
- You know, if you had said 10,000 year span of consciousness with no sleep, i don't know what the hell you'd be if that was who you were, but you would be human, and then we also don't understand that.
- See, part of the problem, i think, with the perspective that the technology to human existence is that there's a reductionism there, that's something.
- It's something like there's no difference between us and the gist of our linguistic network, something like that, like whatever we are is conscious of a lot deeper than the patterns of what make up our cortical existence.
- Consciousness is way deeper than cortical existence and maybe i do think you have to sort of this question of where where does consciousness arise?
- Traditional, christian, but it drives many more cells, eventually reaching to an adult human has 30 to 40 trillion cells.
- So where, where, where, where does is it?
- Where is consciousness right?
- Does it grow slowly?
- Is there a step change?
- And you know i tend to generally believed in physics and you seem to have done pretty well and everything else is a recommendation.
- So if you, if you have beliefs that are incompatible with a rocket, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right now is a host, judge, that's definitely, definitely.
- Do you think he's llms like?
- Do you think that any of the machinery that you've interacted with is showing anything, signs of anything that might be equated to consciousness.
- Mineola limbs are remarkable right in, they certainly pass the turing test as far as i'm concerned- period tokens, and those tokens are more than one letter, and so it actually really it's.
- It's my office with respect to single letters.
- Go to resolution problem.
- Yeah, yeah, you can get around with this with like weird tricks, like if you have to write a computer program to count the number of letters in a word, it can create that computer program, run it and then and then get the number of letters correct.
- Right now is nothing conscious, potentially, and i think you want to, just when you're trying to understand something, consider the various possible answers, and i think that there's a probability associated with each one of these answers.
- Now, if physics is correct, universe started off with and that that coalesced into stars, that exploded when a car, less than stars, you had the formation of heavier elements and and then those dogs have scattered and then reformed and made new stars and so eventually got elements that are higher in the periodic table besides the ones.
- Yeah, so this is, this is what physics consciousness?
- Well, yeah, so the point is that the universe- and give it enough time, you have more, your complex heavy elements and will, complex molecules and and then, 13.8 billion years later, at least on this planet, we have what we call consciousness, in the form you know.
- But that means consciousness had to arise from hydrogen.
- I've seen your comments to the same sort of thing that my friend jonathan has been trying to elucidate: structure of possibility.
- He associates with the concept of heaven, like there's an implicit structure of possibility that material forms are trying to flush out.
- The possibility of consciousness is inherent in the hydrogen atoms, right, obviously, because representations.
- You have three fundamental elements.
- You have something like order which you can think about is society, but it's, it's the, it's the, a prairie, axiomatic interpretive structure.
- You have that.
- Then you have chaotic potential.
- That's the tofu that exists at the beginning of time, and so the way god is represented in the story of genesis is that.
- So god is the a priori interpretive process that gives rise to order as a consequence of manipulating potential, and the intermediary factor is the word.
- That's the christian conception, and the word is something like the sacrificial gesture that's that's necessary for learning to take place.
- So you can imagine this: when you learn something, it's not only that you add to a storehouse that you have, it's that something that you already know has to undergo a death and a transformational.
- Most real learning is painful.
- You think about it.
- More chaos is associated with.
- That can be exciting, but it can also be destabilizing- not existential crisis- that you have had great potential.
- It was without its pain, right.
- So if you imagine the axiom hierarchy go, the more chaos is released when that actually was challenged.
- You get a negative national response to that with his anxiety and threat, because god only knows what happens when all hell breaks loose.
- But there's a positive aspect too.
- That's why it's a dragon and a treasure always in the hero mythology.
- It's because when all hell breaks loose, there's a man's opportunity and so- and that's part of the meaning- now i think you capitalize on that treasure, let's say on the treasure portion of that chaos, by assuming something like your own ignorance, by allowing your initial preconceptions to die and by tracking the trail of deep and insistent questioning.
- So now you, your questioning, took the place.
- If i got it right, you basically took the scientific fact.
- Is that right?
- Because i'm trying to send a truth, the truth of the universe, and physics is essentially study of the truth of the universe, at least those things that are predictable: existential crisis, which happened about the same time years did i started.
- I didn't study science precisely, i wasn't as interested in the transformations of the material world, so i'm probably more people-oriented than thing oriented temperamentally.
- So i started study evil.
- That was my delving into the depths, because i wanted to crack that.
- I want to understand, if not so much because i became consistent with that very quickly, but what exactly that had to do with me?
- Cuz when i was reading history tomorrow, i try to understand the rise and fall of civilizations.
- And what do you think makes them fall?
- Or one of the things is a decreasing birth rate, which seems to be a natural consequence of prosperity.
- As far as i know, that is experience, population of the emergence, something like a, a nonstick egocentrism.
- Well, examples of civilizations prosperous: there is generally a trend towards hedonism.
- Well, you can get away with it if you're worth it, because the consequences of exactly precisely so you know if you're, if you're a civilization, who was in the varieties of religious experience, and that really had an effect on me, because i think that you need something akin to an existential threat in order to set you straight.
- I think there's some truth about you know, it's like if it's a, if it's a spoiled child, that were everything he or she wants, and you have sort of a veruca salt is a civilization.
- I think it's the right way to think about it: developmentally, a neuropsychology, because maturation itself consists of two processes.
- Let's say, i am, the more i'm bringing other people into the purview of my vision, so i extend myself across other people.
- Be my family first, but then brought the community more broadly.
- The better you aren't that, the more people you can play a game with at the same time.
- But you also do the same thing with the future, and that's actually, as far as i can tell, what the cortex is, for it's to move you away from primordial hedonistic motivation to this morning inclusive sense of future and community right, and that's higher order self, and so the default would be immaturity, and wealth can obviously facilitate that, and maybe it's partly because, okay, so you're a very wealthy man, you can give your children anything they ever ask for fights, and a father who is a difficult creature.
- To continue, and are you grateful for it or are you unhappy about it?
- I guess you never know the things that really made you who you are today.
- So at the end of the day, am i on netflix for my life?
- I am.
- I'm leaving the rough details of your childhood: a lot of physical nations and a lot of i don't know exactly what i mean.
- I was almost beaten to death within an inch of my life at one point location.
- About that, cuz, that's a pathway that people take.
- I think that people do take the path of vengeance and justify it by recourse to the reality of their own suffering.
- So the story of joke.
- One of the things i concluded from the story of joke, because it's a precursor to the- the first decision is that, no matter how terrible things become for him, he will not lose faith in himself.
- And the second is: no matter what horrors are visited on him by satan himself, he will not lose faith in the.
- What would you say?
- In the spirit that gave rise to the cosmic order?
- Right, no matter what?
- Well, so you know why.
- I'm not a particularly religious person.
- The teachings of jesus are good, and why is, and that there's tremendous wisdom.
- And turn the other cheek, and for a while- that's really a week.
- Yeah, i think you should turn the others with them, but they need to stop, stop playing.
- You know, make peace, christianity proclamation or admission that, if you compare different societies and their axiomatic suppositions, he would prefer the ones predicated on christianity assumptions, and i do think those are good ones.
- Okay, so, okay, so.
- So that's why i asked you the question about why you would consider yourself not a religious person, because it seems to me that the essence of it isn't, it isn't the statement that you abide by a particular protestant creed, let's say, it seems to be much more akin to the notion that you believe that this set of axiomatic positions is like the name society: the greatest happiness for humanity.
- What's the weather in?
- In, in, in, hungry, down by 38% with no compulsion.
- Right, they have a 12-week limit of hungary.
- Yeah, they've increased the proportion of women in the labor force by about 15%.
- They've knocked the divorce rate down substantially and, at minimum, they've decreased the decline in the birth rate.
- I don't know if they've actually managed to tilt it back up and hungry yet, but they spend about 7% of their gdp on family policy and this ark enterprise we've been building in london made family policy a center point.
- We're trying to bring classic conservatives and liberals together all around the world and you know you're thinking on that need.
- A list front is actually being what would you say is being an input into that?
- Because i started to notice- well, i don't know, i don't think it was 20 years ago that i was, it was, it was not that long ago, but i knew that there was something terribly wrong with the fact that it's so terribly in south korean, japan.
- I think.
- So simple way to do it is say how many babies were born last year and what is the average lifespan in that country, and that, that and then if, if that birth rate, if that number of babies stays constant, then eventually the old people will die and that will be the population of the country.
- It's very straightforward: alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
- So if you want to say japan, which i think had a lot of 800,000 books last year, and then you multiply that by the lifespan, which is around 8 or 85 years, you get to a population of 60 to 70 million range, which is massive decrease from 100 million.
- It seems to me the combination of that lack of engagement on the relationship of profound immortalization, because people, according to the desert, stupidly, we were better off in the tyranny.
- There's no way we're going to survive, right, and the next scouts, or the other set of scouts caleb and joshua come back and say, well, there's trouble there, but if we aim up and we get our act together, we can turn this into the promised land.
- Okay.
- It's at that point that god condemns moses to die and aaron, who's the political wing, and the earth opens up and swallows up the face of the scouts.
- And it's the people who are led by caleb and joshua- who has the same name as christ, by the way, and that's relevant.
- They're the ones that are led into the promised land.
- Okay, so what's the meaning of the story?
- Well, the future is always a challenge and the moral thing to do is to advance in the future regardless.
- In some ways, it's a weird thing, cuz it's kind of regardless of the data, because you can say, well, look at all the suffering that constitutes of the future, and certainly people do hesitate about bringing a child.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, and it's weird because you had to bring a child into the world and you had to pick a time.
- You probably pick this one, and so obviously everybody who had a child, at least by choice, in the past did that in spite of the catastrophe of the future.
- But sorry, it's a long-winded way of making a point.
- There's an ethical requirement that's associated with living in the manner that would justify your life, even to yourself: to have faith and courage in the future, no matter what right.
- So it's not against death, anxiety, directions.
- I have a 12, 12, so you're definitely doing your part.
- What do you like about kids?
- What do you like about kids?
- I mean, there's an older version of okay, so it's quite a big difference- of the youngest- he's full and my, my older boys are 20 and 17218 shortly.
- So what did you like about what's the weather outside?
- The people you'll ever meet in your life who want nothing more than to have the best possible relationship they could have with anyone, with you.
- That's a good deal, and i think there's.
- You know, if we want biologically inclined to love our children and to one another, to them, and find reward, we would long ago have to exist.
- I mean you can take, say, i don't know, a wolf or a wildcat or something, something, and when that creature has babies, the mother earth, hedonistic approach to life.
- I think there's an appeal, even on the hedonism side, to say that, well, what do you not?
- You'll actually find it very rewarding.
- I think that's good, that's good appeal and it's one.
- That's why i think it's a solid argument that people have kids.
- I had a very busy job and i pretty much stopped doing everything except my job and spending time with my kids.
- But if i had to drink those in importance and spending time with my kids, yeah, that was better.
- And if your kids are capable of a modicum of pro-social behavior, which is pretty much your choice, although it makes a difference, there isn't anyone more entertaining to associate with the little kids, because apparently i think it's because they're not as cortically inhibited.
- So my daughter has no filter.
- Filter.
- I do think that and i consider myself an environmentalist, but i think the environmental movement has gone too far.
- And it's going too far in the sense that the internet front vortex evolved so that we can produce disposable avatars, right.
- So i in our conversation, what i'm really doing in our conversation is i'm offering you a potential avatar of myself for the future and i'm saying: why don't you see if you can kill this thing now, so i don't have to act it out and die?
- And that's part of the right, exactly, and so- and we've extended that with games, for example, that and so the reason: the biologists, because they don't actually understand the qualitative difference between human beings and other creatures is that we can let our thoughts die instead of us.
- We so that substitutionary death.
- That's a good way of thinking about it, right, and that means that the mouth- i don't like the idea of natural- absolutely- are everything else, freshwater that is not a natural resource, and kerosene or fossil fuel just laid in the ground until like 1850 because nobody can figure out what the hell to do with it.
- So, so what that implies is that it's something, i think it's a religious ethos.
- That's the natural resource, the religiously thoughts that allows us to orient to the future, to be community-oriented and to and to be trustworthy.
- Yeah, well, at least somebody apply physics or analyzed in a scientific way.
- To say is how many humans can sustain without most people consider to be significant environmental damage, and i think, if you actually do the numbers, i think it's potentially 10 times the population.
- Since the mid-1960s, the moral proclamation has been that there are too many people on the planet, and that is, i think paul ehrlich was the ultimate.
- What exponent of that picture is?
- Analysis was very unscientific, erased on some visit to deli, i believe.
- Right, right, sort of nonsense.
- Do we need to grow food.
- How much would that have?
- What's the actual potential?
- Right, and we are actually quite good at it, right, right, right.
- And is there enough water?
- Well, actually, it's very inexpensive.
- So this is surface area and an energy to to grow food and time, and, increasingly, there's no shortage.
- Right now it's energy dependent to some degree, yeah, but the energy problem is solvable.
- So let's turn to practice your as well.
- So let's start with with open youtube because, well, his, his view is that we'll all be essentially upload on my, the computers, and then humans.
- They won't really be a need for humans.
- And i thought that was.
- I was like: what team are you online?
- Right, right, and i said we really need to make sure humanity thrives and grows, and, and, and, and, and.
- Then he called me a species for saying that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So i'm like, well, i guess i am human.
- And i was like, okay, we really need some company.
- Turn off, the great i research is.
- They had massive computing power, mass of financial resources, and it was very much a unipolar world with respect to ai and unipolar world controlled by larry page and and who you know had.
- I thought so much, so that was the basis for creating company like insufficiently concerned with humans, that's that's a problem, yes, and has all the way so that that that that would be the opposite of of google- would be a non-profit that is open source so you can see what's going on, not a black box incentives to make as much money as possible so openly.
- I started as a, as a non-profit, open source, the open and opening hours to open something.
- So why were you concerned about the prophet of warping things?
- And at that point at least, i think this is particularly a challenge for publicly traded companies.
- You just get sued if you don't maximize profits.
- You know that somebody else directions, not with brock, yeah, so maybe that's the solution.
- Rather like right, sure, the last thing you need is another like immense legal battle- i mean, i'm still considering illegal challenge- to at least have to have the court explain to me how an organization that i founded for one purpose can do the diametrically opposed purpose and become a for-profit.
- Please just show me the trailer.
- What day of ingested the woke my virus in the training?
- You can see some of that in the end of the output results.
- Know, that was really something, that was really something to say.
- That was like a jaw on the floor moment and then asking questions like: is you know which one's worse?
- Do you?
- Are you shocked at the fact that you're donating a substantial amount of money to facilitate trump selection?
- Is that something you would have believed in the realm of possibility, say, 5 years ago?
- Well, and i want to hear california.
- No money in the system then would otherwise be possible.
- The democrat and republican side, yes, and i actually.
- What are you hoping to accomplish with this?
- And what's the pack called america?
- America, could you elucidate?
- Yes, yes, so you know.
- One of them is being a meritocracy, as much, as much of them, as much of a meritocracy as possible, such that you get ahead as a function of your hard work and your skill and nothing else, which is, for example, is nepotism and dynasty absolutely has its price.
- Meritocracy promoting a freedom: freedom to operate, meaning like the least amount of, of, of, of, of government intervention possible.
- We want- and this is, i think, it's important to fight as, because the natural tendency over time- so that was like entropy- is that the hand of government regulations accumulate.
- So that's the evil of the king.
- A very, very old story.
- Very good wrestling with that problem 4000 years ago, right, yeah, so you have to have some.
- You have to really have to take an active role in reducing the number of regulations of past.
- Eventually, everything terms by the government that if we hired anyone who is not a permanent resident of the united states, have either green card or a citizen that i would go to prison, because the presumption of somebody is not a permanent resident is that they will leave the united states and take the rocket technology for spacex to, potentially to countries that would cause harm to the united states.
- And then a few years ago, the biden administration decided to spacex for failing to hire asylum seekers.
- Right, right, yeah, i remember that.
- I remember that.
- So we're talking about, right, well, the purpose.
- You don't need to make damn sure that you're damned correct- right, right, and and and and and why does administration department?
- You know, i don't know if it could just be random, it could be.
- I didn't tell us you know why, because, why, why, why, why do such a crazy lawsuits?
- Even if it is random, that's still bad, but if it's not random, well, it seems like so much.
- And the democratic party in the us is fundamentally controlled by the unions, so i'm speculating here.
- But since, since the factory floor, so that's really exciting.
- That's a real opportunity for people.
- What do you think of trump?
- Well, i mean, i'm not going to you, so for me it's really just got a choice of administration's and we we have to pick one, and i think both their clothes on, and he's a complicated person.
- I've been trying to figure him out because some of the things that look like flaws might be advantageous in disguise like.
- He seems to me pretty good.
- It's standing up to psychopathic bullies, for example, and that's kind of a useful skill and it's not easy.
- You have to be a bit of a monster to manage that, and it isn't obvious to me how many of the- even the divisive- idiosyncrasies of trump are the mirror image of his capacity to stand up to bullies, and that's a tough call, man.
- So you obviously decided to lay your efforts down on the side of the trump administration in the fourth company was the party of america.
- Yeah, and these days that party on so, so weirdly, the- in my view, the republican party is actually the party of that.
- That's the, the meritocracy party, cuz you know the democrats also promoting dui, which is really just another form of racism and sexism.
- America credit.
- So then write the primary.
- What would you say conceptual distinction between individuals.
- Yes, yes, i think the evidence has made things much more.
- When my kids grew up, i would say they were racist, ethnicity and gender blind.
- Siri, play with the san francisco.
- It's a really ugly thing to see.
- So, yeah, not good, not good.
- Yeah.
- So my view, and it is that at this point in the united states, the republican party is more in line with meritocracy and with personal freedom.
- So i never had a conservative.
- Many times with my left wing friends, let's say, they refuse to talk to someone, me included- definition for a very long time, and i've got like absolutely nowhere with that.
- They'll talk to me in private, they will not talk to me in public, and so that's.
- That's never happened.
- On the republican side.
- I found it much easier because talk to a lot of democrats and a lot of republicans, and i found it much, much easier to talk to the republicans, and that is somewhat of a shark.
- I wouldn't have necessarily expected that.
- Yeah, and i should be clear that i said like: i think the republican party is flawless.
- It certainly isn't.
- It's got its issues.
- There are extremists within the republican party that i don't agree with, but one has its a two-party system.
- America needs a strong leader and with that we have the perception of strength.
- Now you have to admire that trump.
- After getting shot with blood streaming down his face, it could have been a second shooter, who knows.
- Nonetheless, you know, i mean this is not funny.
- I think they are a pack of contemptible cowards and i think that everyone who's been involved in this in relationship to minors should go to prison.
- Okay, okay, okay, why do you agree?
- What like what?
- What, what's your?
- Or in the water in this particular, this is the worst medical and psychological malpractice i've ever seen anywhere, including what i've done, what i've studied in reference to historical atrocity eugenics, what do you call those?
- Prefrontal lobotomy?
- Even the sorts of things that we're going on in nazi germany.
- At least the bloody nazis new it was wrong and tried to hide it.
- So, okay, so what, what's your?
- What's your?
- Why are you engaged in this particular battle?
- Mean, you said you're going to move a couple of your company headquarters out of california because of the last legislative with regards to the transition.
- So yes, i mean yes, and i was like, look, it's not that it's the wine store is just the final straw, that's okay.
- I've had conversations with before where i said if you, if you pass legislation is out of california and you that, ahead of time, cancel, ok, google.
- The reality is that almost every child goes through some kind of identity crisis.
- You know exactly, it's just part of growing up.
- If so, it's very possible for for adults to manipulate children into who are having a natural identity crisis, into believing that they are the wrong gender and the other gender, and then they give them sterilizing drugs.
- Yeah, it's macabre, and we have an age of consent for a reason that the reason you can't get, say, tattoos at age 18 or drink or drive.
- You know, i wish you can do things, because if we allow children 1, 0, 1, 2, 4. where i was, i was actually tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, xavier.
- This is before i had really understanding what was going on in the covid going on, and so there was a lot of confusion.
- And you know, i was told no reliable clinician ever believed that.
- There was never any evidence for that.
- And also, if there's a higher suicide rate, the reason is because of the underlying depression and anxiety and not because of the gender dysphoria, and every goddamn clinician knows that too, and they're too cowardly to come out and say it right and so that.
- And then we end up in exactly when i saw that propagation: agree to this radical transformation, that their children are going to die, and you think that's moral and you think that's true.
- That's so.
- That is so pathological that it's almost incomprehensible.
- I can't imagine anything worse.
- I can't imagine the therapist doing anything worse than that, or sitting by idling, remaining silent while his colleagues are doing it.
- It's pathetic, it's incredibly evil, and i agree with you that people that have been promoting this should go to prison.
- It won't stop until that happens.
- Yeah, it'll just go underground.
- There's all puberty blockers are being accessed online by kidz bop channels.
- So, yeah, it's not going to stop.
- Okay, so i see, so that's right.
- It wasn't explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs.
- So, anyway, and so i lost my son, essentially.
- So you know they, they call it for a reason.
- It's because your son is dead.
- So my son, xavier, is dead, killed by the woke, my virus.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I can't imagine the club.
- Okay, let's end on something positive.
- You're shooting for mars.
- What do you think that's doing for people?
- Cuz it's kind of i don't want to be, i don't want to step out of my box here, but it's.
- It's really interesting to me to watch you do this because it's preposterous- right, it's a preposterous thing to do to go to mars.
- And yet i was old enough when the moon landing was happening to remember what that was like.
- Right, it was an adventure, positive adventure, everybody could, and it was an unbelievable technological.
- What do you think you're doing with this, with the mars venture?
- I think is part of the expansion of consciousness.
- I don't think we should apply some vast number amount of resources to to mars.
- I'm talking about less than 1% of our economic output should go to making life multi-planet, but it is a natural extension of expanding the scope of scale of consciousness.
- So i think we want to do everything we can to make sure that earth is going to be great for a long time, as long as possible, and but also allocate a small amount of resources to extending life beyond earth and and ultimately to other star systems.
- Right, and so that's.
- That's perfectly in keeping with what you described at the beginning meaning of the of our discussion, about the manner in which you resolved your crisis of it as a child, your commitment to the validity of consciousness, your, your desire to what would you say facilitated transformation, development, extension.
- That goes along with your pro-human ethos, right, so that's all thinking from first principles.
- So i think you are stuck in the religious camp.
- One word other so i can say that i don't mind, but i think so.
- I want to end with this, if you don't mind.
- So i also asked you why you trust yourself in relationship.
- To answer, but i mean more broadly, like you have a lot of admirers, there's a lot of people who are hoping that you're the guy, that you- what would you say?
- That you're the guy who can do what you say you're going to do.
- There's lots of evidence that you can.
- It's like you think it's reasonable for people to trust you.
- Well, i think so.
- I mean, i wouldn't say trust me, but i think, on balance, my track record suggests that i'm barely trustworthy.
- What elements of it do you think suggest that particularly well?
- I've built a lot of companies that have been useful things.
- Yeah, right now- and you accept the validity of entrepreneurial- i wouldn't be able to recruit people to work with me to movies, i think, if i was like a really bad person.
- So you know, i think like one of the tests.
- For you know, assessing someone's character is to look at the character of their friends and their associates, and while people can put up a mask themselves for their character, their friends and associates will not, and so you can charge it: charge a person's character by the princess associate.
- Thank you all right, thank you very much appreciated.
- Very good to talk to you, it was real privilege.
