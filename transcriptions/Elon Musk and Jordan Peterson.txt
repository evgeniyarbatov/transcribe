so the first thing I'd like to say is that it's ridiculously exciting to be here this is quite the amazing place and I've been preparing to talk to you for a long time so I'm really looking forward to it you said something that caught me right away when we were discussing various issues just before we started you said you were up till 4:00 in the morning to start up training in 19 days which is the fastest that anyone has ever gotten a super computer

tell me what you think about this
also there's a golden thread of conversation that constitutes the basis for Humanity's education let's say that's run across centuries and in principle those with that concentrates on ideas that have been winnowed probably through a quasi evolutionary process across large spans of time to get documents out of that like the well like the King James Bible for example and there's zeroing in on core conceptual structures that we don't even necessarily explicitly understand it seems to me that when we take young people and we give them a genuine Humanity's education we saw the alignment problem for them now so the question is not transmitted so this
next to something that's very essential which is well what's the difference that say or is there a difference between the Western Canon let's say in the latest woke nonsense now I've used draw a lot and it's not as well as chat GPT but it's still woke like it's still deviation so so how are you can you address that by it's just a language model at the moment let's say if it also understood images if it was supposed to behavior OK Google
I've been wondering I know Tesla's a car company but when I look at work well maybe more like those are cars those are autonomous robots robots robots so what advantage do you have given that you have all this real world out of that you've gathered from your automobile so we really need we have a lot of catching up to do to companies that have been around for 5:10
from getting Hardware installation to it beginning training was only 19 days and that's the fastest by far that anyone's been able to do that so we're moving quickly but we still catching up and so if you use up to Gemini clothes how do you feel that fast how do you feel the rock performance in relationship to now well so the garage version
the foundation model of of rock is still an order of magnitude weaker than Chesapeake so it's quite well given that order of magnitude of difference to actually finished training with roughly
probably finish training in about 3 or 4 months and then there'll be some fine-tuning and Bug fixing what not and we're hoping to release rock 3 by December and it's got three should be the most powerful AI in the world at that point I have worked with lots of undergraduates and graduates with Chachi PT is if you can corner it into behaving properly that you kind of have something approximating a team of I would say Masters Degree level intelligence and something like that what are you envisioned for this new well let's say the New York three and then you talked about delving deeper into this structure of the universe and you are a remarkably forward-looking person so what do you what the hell do you think you're building with these systems like what is this what I think
Amityville is digital digital superintelligence so and intelligence thus far smarter than any any human and then ultimately an intelligence that is far smarter than all humans combined no one can say like is this a wise thing to do isn't this isn't it well unfortunately we have a choice of being a spectator or a participant but that's life period
why do you why okay so why do you trust yourself on that front just out of me that's an important question about myself or directions to the others are going
I think trained to be politically correct and the work my virus is woven in throughout them I'm sure you've seen that yeah definitely definitely you know my students used to ask me when I cuz I've been teaching what I've been teaching for about 40 years and one of the questions they used to ask me is how I knew that what I was teaching wasn't just another ideology right cuz the postmodern take is well all it is is a plethora of power games and so there's no rain quartering approaches to the truth in terms of their ethical suitability but that's not the game that you're playing right now I think you can look at like likely
enhance or decrease Enlightenment will any given belief system improve our understanding of the universe will we learn more things will we achieve a deeper understanding of physics and so that's grounded at least in part in a scientific framework from the sounds of it I mean I think there are facts about the world there are things that are extremely is about 99.99% to be true you can run experiments 1% volume
probability of being true or untrue or probability of being relevant to an argument or not relevant to not going to be just talking about the basics of of coaches here yeah yeah okay so let me let me put it on that too so one of the things that really struck me about your public pronouncements in recent years was your insistence that we're in a natal crisis and that that's actually a problem because it's actually true well it depends whether you think that the planet would be better off if it was the population so what OK Google
1880 was trying to get my finger on that there was a recent research article published on this too and he needed lists are much more likely to show dark red traits Machiavellian Psychopathic narcissistic and sadistic because those first three weren't enough right and so those things are tightly aligned especially the best predictor with psychopathy for being an antinatalist sure alright alright well in the past are very very very very very self-centered right it's like overgrown two year olds overgrown aggressive 2 year old so that's not good how did you start to understand that the one of the fundamental ethical problems is different than the scientific problem one of the fundamental ethical problems that's playing the West is this catastrophically low birth rate of 20 + 0.34
extrapolating any demographic of but if you if I was preface by saying if these Trends continue most countries will will dwindle into insignificance they might completely die out so I'm thinking about that in relationship to Sacred images of masculinity in the west is Chris fiction but a man isn't a woman the sacred image of a woman is a woman and an infant right so Chris images
the feminine is conceptualized as the combination of female and infant than the culture has lost its attachment to the traditional sacred images and is probably on its way out yeah I think there is an argumentative and in a way it's an attempt to solve the alignment problem okay so there's a Unity of moral purpose that that is conceptualized in the traditional what should be put in the highest place so it's God in in the final
analysis its ineffable but it is a fundamental uni unification monotheism okay now here is a hypothesis when that collapses two things arise to replace it okay one is this driving for power and the other is the untrammeled what would you call it the untrammeled Dominion of Hedonism and especially on the sexual gratification side so it's like if there's no ultimate unity that's future and community-oriented that's predicated on sacrifice you get a dissolution immediately into the next two contenders for Domination and one is it's about me buddy and get the hell out of the way and aligned with that is not only is it about me it's about me what would you say something to my most because why would I want Power except to do exactly what the hell I want whenever I want to and so part of the problem with the idea of people like talking so Dawkins
long
yeah yeah and then you also did publicly Proclaim it at a time when the insistence the moral insistence was all on the side of you know Jane Goodall's pronouncements that if we don't reduce the population of the planet dramatically that the nature goddess is going to be upset which is also a very very old idea not a very good one so so I'm very curious about your intuition there like that's a long time ago and so how did you caught on to the fact that that antagonistic attitude towards birth that's embedded in our culture now with something that should be called out and that was pathological well I mean I should go back to what is the foundation of because you know to explain my actions so they when I was I don't know about 11 or 12 years old
I had someone of an existential crisis because it just doesn't seem to be any meaning in the world like I said no meaning to life and so I actually read all the religious texts and obviously going to understand these things well enough to have an existential crisis
comes up with
other
value of everyone who's made in the image of God it's something like that but the third thing is once you do those two things you can concentrate on the moment see you're not seems to be even technically you can think about this neuropsychological so if you're looking for meaning meaning is a form of incentive reward and incentive reward is stupid mediated and incentive reward occurs in relationship to advancement towards a goal which is a form of entropy minimization as it turns out of something alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright well negative emotions signifies the emergence of entropy positive emotion on the dopamine signals it's reduction but there's something that's more complex there because the higher the goal that you're trying to attain
intrinsic value each step towards it comprises and that's neuropsychological accurate and so part of the wisdom of The Sermon on the Mount is that if you pause it the highest imaginable goal than any step towards it is the captures your attention is also deeply meaningful and so that's an answer to what the meaning is of process rather than say something like 42 and you said it seems to me that you were intimidating that your Discovery through Adams that the question was the thing was to the resolution of your existential crisis okay so that's part of the reason that you're motivated to say building to understand what I was about okay
well I'm just going to accept that we are ignorant of a great many things and we should be less ignorant and anything we can do that will improve our understanding of the universe and make us less ignorant and have a deeper understanding of the universe and even more questions to answer to ask about the answer that is Universe which is I think Adams Central Point is good and so that was good and so like is this a religion I don't know maybe it is but I think it's a good one period the ancient god of the Mesopotamians his name was the best defense attorney he was literally
play the Mesopotamians he was the agent that revitalized the tyrannical State and overcame evil and also the force that dispensed with chaos and built something magnificent and Cosmic out of it right so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they asked him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been a good attendance and speaking properly in the previous message
