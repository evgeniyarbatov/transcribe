so the first thing I'd like to say is that it's ridiculously exciting to be here this is quite the amazing place and I've been preparing to talk to you for a long time so I'm really looking forward to it you said something that caught me right away when we were discussing various issues just before we started you said you were up till 4:00 in the morning to start up training in 19 days which is the fastest that anyone has ever gotten a super computer

tell me what you think about this
also there's a golden thread of conversation that constitutes the basis for Humanity's education let's say that's run across centuries and in principle those with that concentrates on ideas that have been winnowed probably through a quasi evolutionary process across large spans of time to get documents out of that like the well like the King James Bible for example and there's zeroing in on core conceptual structures that we don't even necessarily explicitly understand it seems to me that when we take young people and we give them a genuine Humanity's education we saw the alignment problem for them now so the question is not transmitted so this
next to something that's very essential which is well what's the difference that say or is there a difference between the Western Canon let's say in the latest woke nonsense now I've used draw a lot and it's not as well as chat GPT but it's still woke like it's still deviation so so how are you can you address that by it's just a language model at the moment let's say if it also understood images if it was supposed to behavior OK Google
I've been wondering I know Tesla's a car company but when I look at work well maybe more like those are cars those are autonomous robots robots robots so what advantage do you have given that you have all this real world out of that you've gathered from your automobile so we really need we have a lot of catching up to do to companies that have been around for 5:10
from getting Hardware installation to it beginning training was only 19 days and that's the fastest by far that anyone's been able to do that so we're moving quickly but we still catching up and so if you use up to Gemini clothes how do you feel that fast how do you feel the rock performance in relationship to now well so the garage version
the foundation model of of rock is still an order of magnitude weaker than Chesapeake so it's quite well given that order of magnitude of difference to actually finished training with roughly
probably finish training in about 3 or 4 months and then there'll be some fine-tuning and Bug fixing what not and we're hoping to release rock 3 by December and it's got three should be the most powerful AI in the world at that point I have worked with lots of undergraduates and graduates with Chachi PT is if you can corner it into behaving properly that you kind of have something approximating a team of I would say Masters Degree level intelligence and something like that what are you envisioned for this new well let's say the New York three and then you talked about delving deeper into this structure of the universe and you are a remarkably forward-looking person so what do you what the hell do you think you're building with these systems like what is this what I think
Amityville is digital digital superintelligence so and intelligence thus far smarter than any any human and then ultimately an intelligence that is far smarter than all humans combined no one can say like is this a wise thing to do isn't this isn't it well unfortunately we have a choice of being a spectator or a participant but that's life period
why do you why okay so why do you trust yourself on that front just out of me that's an important question about myself or directions to the others are going
I think trained to be politically correct and the work my virus is woven in throughout them I'm sure you've seen that yeah definitely definitely you know my students used to ask me when I cuz I've been teaching what I've been teaching for about 40 years and one of the questions they used to ask me is how I knew that what I was teaching wasn't just another ideology right cuz the postmodern take is well all it is is a plethora of power games and so there's no rain quartering approaches to the truth in terms of their ethical suitability but that's not the game that you're playing right now I think you can look at like likely
enhance or decrease Enlightenment will any given belief system improve our understanding of the universe will we learn more things will we achieve a deeper understanding of physics and so that's grounded at least in part in a scientific framework from the sounds of it I mean I think there are facts about the world there are things that are extremely is about 99.99% to be true you can run experiments 1% volume
probability of being true or untrue or probability of being relevant to an argument or not relevant to not going to be just talking about the basics of of coaches here yeah yeah okay so let me let me put it on that too so one of the things that really struck me about your public pronouncements in recent years was your insistence that we're in a natal crisis and that that's actually a problem because it's actually true well it depends whether you think that the planet would be better off if it was the population so what OK Google
1880 was trying to get my finger on that there was a recent research article published on this too and he needed lists are much more likely to show dark red traits Machiavellian Psychopathic narcissistic and sadistic because those first three weren't enough right and so those things are tightly aligned especially the best predictor with psychopathy for being an antinatalist sure alright alright well in the past are very very very very very self-centered right it's like overgrown two year olds overgrown aggressive 2 year old so that's not good how did you start to understand that the one of the fundamental ethical problems is different than the scientific problem one of the fundamental ethical problems that's playing the West is this catastrophically low birth rate of 20 + 0.34
extrapolating any demographic of but if you if I was preface by saying if these Trends continue most countries will will dwindle into insignificance they might completely die out so I'm thinking about that in relationship to Sacred images of masculinity in the west is Chris fiction but a man isn't a woman the sacred image of a woman is a woman and an infant right so Chris images
the feminine is conceptualized as the combination of female and infant than the culture has lost its attachment to the traditional sacred images and is probably on its way out yeah I think there is an argumentative and in a way it's an attempt to solve the alignment problem okay so there's a Unity of moral purpose that that is conceptualized in the traditional what should be put in the highest place so it's God in in the final
analysis its ineffable but it is a fundamental uni unification monotheism okay now here is a hypothesis when that collapses two things arise to replace it okay one is this driving for power and the other is the untrammeled what would you call it the untrammeled Dominion of Hedonism and especially on the sexual gratification side so it's like if there's no ultimate unity that's future and community-oriented that's predicated on sacrifice you get a dissolution immediately into the next two contenders for Domination and one is it's about me buddy and get the hell out of the way and aligned with that is not only is it about me it's about me what would you say something to my most because why would I want Power except to do exactly what the hell I want whenever I want to and so part of the problem with the idea of people like talking so Dawkins
long
yeah yeah and then you also did publicly Proclaim it at a time when the insistence the moral insistence was all on the side of you know Jane Goodall's pronouncements that if we don't reduce the population of the planet dramatically that the nature goddess is going to be upset which is also a very very old idea not a very good one so so I'm very curious about your intuition there like that's a long time ago and so how did you caught on to the fact that that antagonistic attitude towards birth that's embedded in our culture now with something that should be called out and that was pathological well I mean I should go back to what is the foundation of because you know to explain my actions so they when I was I don't know about 11 or 12 years old
I had someone of an existential crisis because it just doesn't seem to be any meaning in the world like I said no meaning to life and so I actually read all the religious texts and obviously going to understand these things well enough to have an existential crisis
comes up with
other
value of everyone who's made in the image of God it's something like that but the third thing is once you do those two things you can concentrate on the moment see you're not seems to be even technically you can think about this neuropsychological so if you're looking for meaning meaning is a form of incentive reward and incentive reward is stupid mediated and incentive reward occurs in relationship to advancement towards a goal which is a form of entropy minimization as it turns out of something alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright well negative emotions signifies the emergence of entropy positive emotion on the dopamine signals it's reduction but there's something that's more complex there because the higher the goal that you're trying to attain
intrinsic value each step towards it comprises and that's neuropsychological accurate and so part of the wisdom of The Sermon on the Mount is that if you pause it the highest imaginable goal than any step towards it is the captures your attention is also deeply meaningful and so that's an answer to what the meaning is of process rather than say something like 42 and you said it seems to me that you were intimidating that your Discovery through Adams that the question was the thing was to the resolution of your existential crisis okay so that's part of the reason that you're motivated to say building to understand what I was about okay
well I'm just going to accept that we are ignorant of a great many things and we should be less ignorant and anything we can do that will improve our understanding of the universe and make us less ignorant and have a deeper understanding of the universe and even more questions to answer to ask about the answer that is Universe which is I think Adams Central Point is good and so that was good and so like is this a religion I don't know maybe it is but I think it's a good one period the ancient god of the Mesopotamians his name was the best defense attorney he was literally
play the Mesopotamians he was the agent that revitalized the tyrannical State and overcame evil and also the force that dispensed with chaos and built something magnificent and Cosmic out of it right so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they asked him to confess all the ways that he hadn't been a good attendance and speaking properly in the previous message
if you don't use that Vision if each citizen doesn't use that Vision it's replaced by the totalitarian All-Seeing Eye right right so that's a hell of a thing to know okay so that okay so that's cool so I wonder I see I see cuz I wondered what motivated you cuz you pushing so many directions simultaneously you have to be really highly motivated to do that and so you figured out that the question in a sense was the answer the question and a better understanding of the universe is something that we can continue to do as a civilization for a very long time yeah yeah like forever so that's okay
on things that improve our understanding of the universe at a base level well this is why I actually think we want to population increase because population increase means that there are more people that we've expanded the scale yeah we've expanded the scale of consciousness of Consciousness so that there's something of marks and he went and looked at Mark's poetry and drama that he wrote before he wrote The Communist Manifesto and he found out something very interesting he found out that marks his favorite quote from Bertha was a statement by Mephistopheles it's a very specific statement and it's a very
motivation so Lucifer's motivation is predicated on this argument said Consciousness is nothing but consciousness of pain and misery life is short and brutal and pointless therefore it would be better if Consciousness itself was eradicated understand that life without social order would degenerated into that but the Memphis Tennessee it is the very definition of crazy right now the definition of the adversarial Spirit now let's say
is that that's wrong in the Consciousness should be so then we say so why should Consciousness be expanded if it's nothing but consciousness of suffering and your answer lots of people suffer like slots an existential crisis so it's it's it's it's not it's an obviously false statement that life is really so one of the things I've tried to do is to understand so like there are a limited number of things that are


but I was very close with with Larry Page is one of my best friends and in fact I'd stay at his house because I've spent half the week in the Bay Area running Tesla in half in La running SpaceX and and for the longest time I never even had a house in the area I would just stay at friends friends places that spare room I stay there if they didn't have to sleep on the couch and and I find actually I didn't have a house for more than a decade road to catch up with friends and and so I would have these conversations with our page long into the night about increasingly concerned that he was not sufficiently concerned about AI safety
and I want point he did call me a species yes you are one yes yes I guess correctly labeled like the other people and everyone will just be robots yeah and for a while
the price of our intrinsic limitations and that is a difficult bitter let's say pill to swallow but I also think so I thought recently you know how do you know that something's real say death makes things real death makes things real and so if you if you eradicate death it seems to me that in some fundamental level you also eradicate reality itself so I don't know because I think you really could evolve human evolution it's better for organisms to have a finite life and
death death brings renewal essentially and I think we do need to be cautious about trying to solve longevity in a love forever type sense because I think our our society our culture would ossify and the people in power would always remain in power you know if you had said 10,000 year span of Consciousness with no sleep I don't know what the hell you'd be if that was who you were but you would be human and then we also don't understand that see part of the problem I think with the perspective that the technology to human existence is that there's a reductionism there that's something it's something like there's no difference between us and the gist of our linguistic Network something like that like whatever we are is conscious of a lot deeper than the patterns of
what make up our cortical existence Consciousness is way deeper than cortical existence and maybe I do think you have to sort of this question of where where does Consciousness arise traditional Christian
but it drives many more cells eventually reaching to an adult human has 30 to 40 trillion cells so where where where where does is it where is consciousness right does it grow slowly is there a step change and you know I tend to generally believed in physics and you seem to have done pretty well and everything else is a recommendation so if you if you have beliefs that are incompatible with a rocket right right right right right right right right now is a host judge
that's definitely definitely do you think he's llms like do you think that any of the Machinery that you've interacted with is showing anything signs of anything that might be equated to Consciousness Mineola limbs are remarkable right in they certainly pass the Turing test as far as I'm concerned period
tokens and those tokens are more than one letter and so it actually really it's it's my office with respect to single letters go to resolution problem yeah yeah you can get around with this with like weird tricks like if you have to write a computer program to count the number of letters in a word it can create that computer program run it and then and then get the number of letters correct right now is nothing conscious potentially and I think you want to just when you're trying to understand something consider the various possible answers and I think that there's a probability associated with each one of these answers now if physics is correct Universe started off with
and that that coalesced into stars that exploded when a car less than Stars you had the formation of heavier elements and and then those dogs have scattered and then reformed and made new stars and So eventually got elements that are higher in the periodic table besides the ones yeah so this is this is what physics Consciousness well yeah so the point is that the Universe and give it enough time
you have more your complex heavy elements and will complex molecules and and then 13.8 billion years later at least on this planet we have what we call Consciousness in the form you know but that means Consciousness had to arise from hydrogen I've seen your comments to the same sort of thing that my friend Jonathan has been trying to elucidate structure of possibility he Associates with the concept of Heaven like there's an implicit structure of possibility that material forms are trying to flush out the possibility of Consciousness is inherent in the hydrogen atoms right obviously because
representations you have three fundamental elements you have something like order which you can think about is society but it's it's the it's the a prairie axiomatic interpretive structure you have that then you have chaotic potential that's the tofu that exists at the beginning of time and so the way God is represented in the story of Genesis is that so God is the a priori interpretive process that gives rise to order as a consequence of manipulating potential and the intermediary factor is the word that's the Christian conception and the word is something like
the sacrificial gesture that's that's necessary for learning to take place so you can imagine this when you learn something it's not only that you add to a storehouse that you have it's that something that you already know has to undergo a death and a transformational most real learning is painful you think about it more chaos is associated with that can be exciting but it can also be destabilizing not existential crisis that you have had great potential it was without its pain right so if you imagine the Axiom hierarchy go the more chaos is released when that actually was challenged you get a negative
national response to that with his anxiety and threat because God only knows what happens when all hell breaks loose but there's a positive aspect too that's why it's a dragon and a treasure always in the hero mythology it's because when all hell breaks loose there's a man's opportunity and so and that's part of the meaning now I think you capitalize on that treasure let's say on the treasure portion of that chaos by assuming something like your own Ignorance by allowing your initial preconceptions to die and by tracking the trail of deep and insistent questioning so now you your questioning took the place if I got it right you basically took the scientific fact is that right because I'm trying to send a truth the truth of the universe and physics is essentially study of the truth of the universe at least those things that are predictable
existential crisis which happened about the same time years did I started I didn't study science precisely I wasn't as interested in the transformations of the material world so I'm probably more people-oriented than thing oriented temperamentally so I started study evil that was my delving Into the Depths because I wanted to crack that I want to understand if not so much because I became consistent with that very quickly but what exactly that had to do with me cuz when I was reading history tomorrow
I try to understand the rise and fall of civilizations and what do you think makes them fall or one of the things is a decreasing birth rate which seems to be a natural consequence of prosperity as far as I know that is experience population of the emergence
something like a a nonstick egocentrism well examples of civilizations prosperous there is generally a trend towards Hedonism well you can get away with it if you're worth it because the consequences of exactly precisely so you know if you're if you're a civilization
who was in the varieties of religious experience and that really had an effect on me because I think that you need something akin to an existential threat in order to set you straight I think there's some truth about you know it's like if it's a if it's a spoiled child that were everything he or she wants and you have sort of a Veruca Salt is a civilization I think it's the right way to think about it developmentally a neuropsychology because maturation itself consists of two processes let's say I am the more I'm bringing other people into the purview of my vision so I extend myself across other people be my family first but then brought the community more broadly the better
you aren't that the more people you can play a game with at the same time but you also do the same thing with the future and that's actually as far as I can tell what the cortex is for it's to move you away from primordial hedonistic motivation to this morning inclusive sense of future and Community right and that's higher order self and so the default would be immaturity and wealth can obviously facilitate that and maybe it's partly because okay so you're a very wealthy man you can give your children anything they ever ask for
fights and a father who is a difficult creature to continue and are you grateful for it or are you unhappy about it I guess you never know the things that really made you who you are today so at the end of the day am I on Netflix for my life I am I'm leaving the rough details of your childhood a lot of physical
Nations and a lot of I don't know exactly what I mean I was almost beaten to death within an inch of my life at one point location about that cuz that's a pathway that people take I think that people do take the path of Vengeance and justify it by recourse to the reality of their own suffering so the story of joke one of the things I concluded from the story of joke because it's a precursor to the
the first decision is that no matter how Terrible Things become for him he will not lose faith in himself and the second is no matter what Horrors are visited on him by Satan himself he will not lose faith in the what would you say in the spirit that gave rise to the cosmic order right no matter what well so you know why I'm not a particularly religious person the teachings of Jesus are good and why is and that there's tremendous wisdom and turn the other cheek and for a while that's really a week yeah I think you should turn the others with them but they need to stop stop playing you know make peace
Christianity

Proclamation or admission that if you compare different societies and their axiomatic suppositions he would prefer the ones predicated on Christianity assumptions and I do think those are good ones okay so okay so so that's why I asked you the question about why you would consider yourself not a religious person because it seems to me that the essence of it isn't it isn't the statement that you abide by a particular Protestant Creed let's say it seems to be much more akin to the notion that you believe that this set of axiomatic positions is like the name society the greatest happiness for Humanity
